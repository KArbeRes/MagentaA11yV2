How to test a timer

1. Test keyboard only, then screen reader + keyboard actions

   - Tab, arrow keys or ctl+tab: Focus visibly moves to a part of the control that is interactive
   - Spacebar: Activates on iOS and Android
   - Enter: Activates on Android

2. Test mobile screenreader gestures

   - Swipe: Focus moves to the interactive control, expresses its name, role, state (if applicable)
   - Doubletap: Activates the control

3. Listen to screenreader output on all devices

   - Name: Purpose is clear (ex: "Start/Pause")
   - Role: Identifies itself as a button

4. Test device settings

   - Text resize: Text can resize up to 200% without losing information
