   - Two finger swipe: Brings next page into view when focus is not on page control (Android)
   - Swipe and double tap: Brings next page into view when focus is on page control (Android)

3. Listen to screenreader output on all devices

   - Role: Identifies as "adjustable" or button in iOS, "In horizontal pager" in Android
   - Group: n/a
   - State: Expresses its state (disabled/dimmed)
