How to test a tidbit

1. Test keyboard only, then screen reader + keyboard actions

   - Tab, arrow keys or ctl+tab: Focus visibly moves to the tidbit if there is a Call To Action (CTA)
   - Spacebar: Activates CTA on iOS and Android
   - Enter: Activates CTA on Android

2. Test mobile screenreader gestures

   - Swipe: Focus moves to the tidbit or tidbit CTA, expresses its name, role
   - Doubletap: Activates the tidbit CTA

3. Listen to screenreader output on all devices

   - Name: Purpose is clear and matches visible label for CTA and announces all text and meaningful images
   - Role: CTA identifies as a button in iOS and button or "double tap to activate" in Android
   - Group: n/a
   - State: Expresses the CTA's state (disabled/dimmed)

4. Device OS Settings

   - Text resize: Text can resize up to 200% without losing information
