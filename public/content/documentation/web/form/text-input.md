How to test a text input

1. Test keyboard only, then screen reader + keyboard actions

   - Tab: Focus moves visibly to the input unless it's disabled

2. Test mobile screenreader gestures

   - Swipe: Focus moves to the input
   - Keyboard: Keyboard appears

3. Listen to screenreader output on all devices

   - Name: Its purpose is clear
   - Role: It identifies itself as a text input
   - Group: Hints or errors are read after the label, related inputs include a group name (Ex: Enter your personal information)
   - State: If applicable, it expresses its state (required, disabled / dimmed / unavailable)
