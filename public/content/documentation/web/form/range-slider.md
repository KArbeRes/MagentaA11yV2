1. Test keyboard only, then screen reader + keyboard actions

   - Tab: Focus moves visibly to the input
   - Arrow-keys: Increase / decrease value one step

2. Test mobile screenreader gestures

   - Swipe: Focus moves to the input
   - Swipe up/down: Increase/decrease slider value one step on iOS
   - Volume: Increase/decrease slider value one step on Android

3. Listen to screenreader output on all devices

   - Name: Its purpose is clear
   - Role: It identifies itself as a range
   - Group: Its label is read with the input
   - State: Its current value
