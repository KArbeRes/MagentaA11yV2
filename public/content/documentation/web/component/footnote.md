How to test a footnote

1. Test keyboard only, then screen reader + keyboard actions

   - Tab: Focus moves to the footnote link
   - Enter: Activates the link, focus/tabindex moves directly to the targeted element 

2. Test mobile screenreader gestures

   - Swipe: Focus moves to the footnote link
   - Doubletap: Activates the link, focus/tabindex moves directly to the targeted footnote

3. Listen to screenreader output on all devices

   - Name: It describes its purpose
   - Role: It identifies itself as a link
