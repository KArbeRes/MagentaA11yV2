How to test a expander accordion

1. Test keyboard only, then screen reader + keyboard actions

   - Tab: Focus visibly moves to the expander
   - Spacebar: Toggles the expander
   - Enter: Toggles the expander

2. Test mobile screenreader gestures

   - Swipe: Focus moves to the element, expresses its state (expanded/collapsed)
   - Doubletap: Toggles the expander

3. Listen to screenreader output on all devices

   - Name: Its purpose is clear
   - Role: It identifies its role of a button or details
   - State: It expresses its state (expanded/collapsed)
