How to test a toggle switch

1. Test keyboard only, then screen reader + keyboard actions

   - Tab: Focus visibly moves to the switch
   - Spacebar: Toggles the switch between states

2. Test mobile screenreader gestures

   - Swipe: Focus moves to the element, expresses its state
   - Doubletap: Element toggles between states

3. Listen to screenreader output on all devices

   - Name: Its label and purpose is clear
   - Role: It identifies its role of switch, toggle button or checkbox
   - Group: Hints or errors are read after the label and related inputs include a group name (Ex: Account settings)
   - State: It expresses its state (on/off, checked/unchecked, disabled/dimmed)

## Developer Notes

### Name

- Typically doesnâ€™t have a name or description since there must be only one instance per page.
