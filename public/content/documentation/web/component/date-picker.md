How to test a date picker dialog

1. Test keyboard only, then screen reader + keyboard actions

   - Tab: Focus visibly moves to the date grid table and calendar navigation buttons
   - Escape: The dialog closes and focus returns to the launch button
   - Arrow keys: Date selection visibly moves through next/previous days
   - Page up/down: Changes the grid of dates to the previous/next month
   - Shift + page up/down: Changes the grid of dates to the previous/next year
   - Home/end: Moves focus to the first/last day of the current week
   - Spacebar or enter: Activates the date picker buttons and calendar navigation buttons

2. Test mobile screenreader gestures

   - Swipe: Focus moves through elements, expresses its state
   - Doubletap: Activates the element in focus

3. Listen to screenreader output on all devices

   - Name: The purpose of each control is clear
   - Role: Buttons identify as buttons, dialog identifies itself dialog or modal, date grid table may identify itself as table or grid
   - Group: The launch button indicates it has a popup, menu or dialog; days are announced with month and year
   - State: Date options express state (pressed, selected, disabled/dimmed)
