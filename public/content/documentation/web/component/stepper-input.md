How to test a stepper input

1. Test keyboard only, then screen reader + keyboard actions

   - Tab: Focus moves to either the select field or buttons.
   - Enter or spacebar: 
    - If select is focused, expands the select and places focus on the currently selected option in the list. 
    - If focus is in the options, collapses the select and keeps the currently selected option.
    - If focus is on one of the buttons, it will either increment or decrement the value.
   - Arrow-keys: If select is focused, moves focus to and selects the next option.
   - Escape: If the select is displayed, collapses the select and moves focus to the button.
   - Home: If the select is displayed, moves focus to and selects the first option.
   - End: If the select is displayed, moves focus to and selects the last option.

2. Test mobile screenreader gestures

   - Swipe: Moves focus to each form control in the pattern.
   - Double-tap: If select is focused, opens select, selects option. Note: If a button is focused, it will either increment or decrement the value.

3. Listen to screenreader output on all devices

   - Name: Button labels are clear and include context. The select field's visual label is announced.
   - Role: For the select field it identifies itself as a select, popup button, menu/submenu or listbox. For the buttons they are identified as button.
   - Group: Its label is read with the input.
   - State: It indicates when the select is expanded/collapsed, indicates which option is selected.
