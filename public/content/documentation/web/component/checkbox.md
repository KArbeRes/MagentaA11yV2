How to test a checkbox

1. Test keyboard only, then screen reader + keyboard actions

   - Tab: Focus visibly moves to the checkbox
   - Spacebar: Toggles the checkbox between states

2. Test mobile screenreader gestures

   - Swipe: Focus moves to the element, expresses its state
   - Doubletap: Checkbox toggles between checked and unchecked states

3. Listen to screenreader output on all devices

   - Name: Its label and purpose is clear
   - Role: It identifies its role of checkbox
   - Group: Hints or errors are read after the label and related inputs include a group name (ex: Account settings)
   - State: It expresses its state (checked/unchecked, disabled)
