How to test a toast snackbar

1. Test keyboard only, then screen reader + keyboard actions

   - Tab: Focus visibly moves in logical order to buttons or links inside the toast
   - Space: Any buttons inside are activated
   - Enter: Any links or buttons inside are activated

2. Test mobile screenreader gestures

   - Swipe: Focus moves in logical order to the toast
   - Doubletap: This typically activates most elements in the toast

3. Listen to screenreader output on all devices

   - Name: The toast is read when it appears (BUT focus DOES NOT transfer automatically when the toast appears)
   - Role: It identifies itself as an alert or status when it appears
   - Group: If it is possible to close the toast, focus then returns to a logical place in the page
   - State: It remains open until closed by user
