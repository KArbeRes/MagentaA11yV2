## General Notes
> This file was generated using the createMarkdown script.

This section provides general information about this component, including guidelines and best practices.

## Condensed
This section provides a **high-level summary** of the key accessibility criteria.

#### Example Summary:
1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Tab key moves focus logically.
   - Zoom up to 200% is supported.

2. **Mobile Screen Reader Gestures**
   - Swipe moves focus through content.
   - Orientation change does not disrupt accessibility.

3. **Screen Reader Support**
   - The page title is meaningful.
   - Major landmarks are properly defined.

4. **Device OS Settings**
   - Users can resize text without content loss.

More details: [Web Accessibility Checklist](https://www.magentaa11y.com/checklist-web/html/).

## Gherkin
Defines web accessibility acceptance criteria using the **Given, When, Then** format.

### a11y - Web Accessibility Acceptance Criteria

#### Example Scenario:
```gherkin
Feature: Example Feature
  Scenario: Example Scenario
    Given I am a keyboard user
    When I press "Tab" to navigate
    Then I should see a visible focus on interactive elements
```

#### Another Scenario:
```gherkin
Feature: Responsive Design
  Scenario: Zooming in
    Given I zoom in using OS settings
    When I increase text size to 200%
    Then content remains readable without loss of information
```

## Criteria
Lists the specific criteria required for this component to meet accessibility, usability, and functional standards.

#### Example Criteria List:
- [ ] The page must have a **unique** and **descriptive title**.
- [ ] All images must have meaningful **alt text**.
- [ ] Keyboard navigation should allow access to **all interactive elements**.
- [ ] The color contrast must meet **WCAG AA standards**.

## Developer Notes
Contains developer-specific information, including expected behaviors, implementation details, and best practices.

#### Example Notes:
- Use **semantic HTML elements** (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`).
- Ensure **all links are descriptive** (e.g., avoid "Click here").
- **ARIA attributes should be used sparingly**, and only when necessary.

### üõ†Ô∏è Triggering Custom Interactions from Markdown

You can attach **custom behavior** to elements in your markdown using the `data-fn` and `data-event` attributes.

These attributes are handled by our custom React overrides and can be used on any valid HTML tag (e.g., `<button>`, `<div>`, `<a>`) to make them interactive with JavaScript.

---

#### ü§î Why not just use `onClick="..."`?

When writing raw HTML inside a Markdown file, JavaScript event attributes like `onClick="alert('hi')"` are treated as **strings** and **not executable code** in React.

React expects event handlers like `onClick` to be **actual functions**, not strings. If you try to use a string like in plain HTML, React throws an error like:

```
Expected `onClick` listener to be a function, instead got a value of `string` type.
```

To solve this, we use `data-fn="yourFunction"` to reference a function defined in your app, and `data-event="onClick"` to define the event to listen for.

At render time, React looks up the real function from `markdownFunctionMap` and wires it up correctly.

---

#### ‚úÖ Where are these functions defined?

Inside:  
`src/utils/markdownFunctions.ts`

```ts
export const markdownFunctionMap: Record<string, () => void> = {
  showAlert: () => alert('This works with a keyboard and a mouse!'),
  showMouseAlert: () => alert('Mouse only alert'),
  goToHome: () => navigate('/home'),
};
```

---

### üîò Button Example

```html
<button type="button" data-fn="showAlert" data-event="onClick">
  Show Alert
</button>
```

This will call `showAlert()` from `markdownFunctionMap` when clicked.

---

### üîò Div Styled as Button (Accessible)

```html
<div class="button" type="button" tabindex="0" data-fn="showAlert" data-event="onClick">
  Show Alert
</div>
```

This will be rendered as a focusable button-like div that responds to both mouse and keyboard (Enter/Space) events.

---

### üéØ Icon Button Example

You can render an icon button in markdown like this:

```html
<button data-icon="play" data-label="Play" data-fn="showAlert"></button>
```

This will render a circular icon button with the play icon and an accessible label of "Play".
If you omit data-label, no aria-label will be applied.

To see all available icon names, check:
src/shared/icons.ts

---

### üñ±Ô∏è Mouse-Only Interaction

```html
<div class="button" type="button" tabindex="0" data-fn="showMouseAlert" data-event="onMouseDown">
  Mouse Only Alert
</div>
```

This will only trigger on mouse down (and not on keyboard press).

---

### üîó Link Example (No href)

```html
<a data-fn="goToHome" data-event="onClick" tabindex="0">
  Go to Home
</a>
```

This will call `goToHome()` when activated. You don‚Äôt need an `href` if using `data-fn`.

## Android Developer Notes
Provides guidance for implementing this component on **Android** platforms.

#### Example Android-Specific Guidance:
- Ensure **TalkBack** announces elements correctly.
- Use **focusable Views** (`android:focusable="true"`) for better keyboard support.
- Implement **custom accessibility actions** when necessary.

## iOS Developer Notes
Provides guidance for implementing this component on **iOS** platforms.

#### Example iOS-Specific Guidance:
- Test with **VoiceOver** to ensure proper navigation.
- Use **UIAccessibilityTraits** to define element behavior.
- Ensure **Dynamic Type** scales properly when users adjust text size.
