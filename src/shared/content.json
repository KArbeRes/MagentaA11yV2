Adding `tabindex=\"0\"` makes it focusable.\n\n```html\n<div role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" >\n  Continue\n</div>\n```\n\n## When there’s no inner text that text makes sense\n\n* As a last resort, `aria-label` can be used.\n* `aria-label` will (typically) replace the inner text of the button for the screen reader output.\n* DO NOT repeat the inner text in the `aria-label` as some screenreaders will read both.\n\n```html\n<div role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"Continue\">\n  <!-- icon but no text -->\n</div>\n\n<div role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"Buy now, iPhone 17\">\n  Buy now <!-- Ambiguous text doesn't describe the intent -->\n</div>\n```\n\n## When there are repeating buttons\n\nSometimes the design will call for multiple buttons with the same text label. In a case like this, `aria-label` can be used to name each control’s purpose.\n\n```html\n<button aria-label=\"Edit payment date\">\n  Edit\n</div>\n<button aria-label=\"Edit payment amount\">\n  Edit\n</div>\n```\n\n## Developer notes\n\n### Name\n\n* Inner text should describe the purpose of the button.\n* `aria-label=\"Button purpose\"` can also be used (as a last resort)\n\n### Role\n\n* Native button identifies as button by default\n* Use `role=\"button\"` for custom elements\n\n### Group\n\n* Use `aria-haspopup=\"true\"` for menu, listbox or modal\n* `aria-controls=\"popupId\"` is not well supported\n\n### State\n\n* Toggle buttons `aria-pressed=\"true/false\"`\n* Menus or expanders use `aria-expanded=\"true/false\"`\n* Use the `disabled` state for completely inactive buttons that shouldn’t be focusable\n* Use `aria-disabled=\"true/false\"` state for inactive custom elements\n\n### Focus\n\n* Focus must be visible\n* Custom elements (like `<div>`) need `tabindex=\"0\"` to be focusable"

          "developerNotes": "## Code examples\n\n### Use semantic HTML\n\n* This semantic HTML contains all accessibility features by default.\n* It uses [CSS pseudo attributes](https://github.com/tmobile/magentaA11y/blob/main/_sass/modules/_input-checkbox.scss) to create the checkbox indicator, without Javascript.\n\n```html\n<fieldset>\n  <legend>Choose your favorite Sesame Street characters:</legend>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"elmoCheckbox\">\n  <label for=\"elmoCheckbox\">Elmo</label>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"bigBirdCheckbox\">\n  <label for=\"bigBirdCheckbox\">Big Bird</label>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cookieCheckbox\" checked>\n  <label for=\"cookieCheckbox\">Cookie Monster</label>\n</fieldset>\n```\n\n<example>\n<fieldset>\n  <legend>Choose your favorite Sesame Street characters:</legend>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"elmoCheckbox\">\n  <label for=\"elmoCheckbox\">Elmo</label>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"bigBirdCheckbox\">\n  <label for=\"bigBirdCheckbox\">Big Bird</label>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"cookieCheckbox\" checked>\n  <label for=\"cookieCheckbox\">Cookie Monster</label>\n</fieldset>\n</example>\n\n### Don't put interactive elements inside the label\n\nEven though this is valid HTML, it creates unpredictable results with screenreaders. A (currently) reliable method is to keep interactive elements outside the label and reference it with `aria-describedby=\"hint-id\"`\n\n```html\n<fieldset>\n  <legend>Legal disclaimers</legend>\n  <div id=\"hint-tc\" class=\"hint-checkbox\">\n    <a href=\"/code-of-conduct/\">Read terms and conditions</a>\n  </div>\n  <input type=\"checkbox\"\n         id=\"tc-agree\"\n         aria-describedby=\"hint-tc\">\n  <label for=\"tc-agree\">\n    I agree to the terms and conditions\n  </label>\n</fieldset>\n```\n\n<example>\n<fieldset>\n  <legend>Legal disclaimers</legend>\n  <div id=\"hint-tc\" class=\"hint-checkbox\">\n    <a href=\"/code-of-conduct/\">Read terms and conditions</a>\n  </div>\n  <input type=\"checkbox\"\n         id=\"tc-agree\"\n         aria-describedby=\"hint-tc\">\n  <label for=\"tc-agree\">\n    I agree to the terms and conditions\n  </label>\n</fieldset>\n</example>\n\n### Disabled and focusable checkbox (preferred)\n\n* An input using `aria-disabled=\"true` will be focusable with the tab key\n* Use JS to `preventDefault()`\n\n```html\n<fieldset>\n  <legend>Choose your favorite fruit</legend>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"lemonsCheckbox\" aria-disabled=\"true\" checked>\n  <label for=\"lemonsCheckbox\">Lemons</label>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"limesCheckbox\" aria-disabled=\"true\">\n  <label for=\"limesCheckbox\">Limes</label>\n\n</fieldset>\n```\n\n<example>\n<fieldset>\n  <legend>Choose your favorite fruit</legend>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"lemonsCheckbox\" aria-disabled=\"true\" checked>\n  <label for=\"lemonsCheckbox\">Lemons</label>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"limesCheckbox\" aria-disabled=\"true\">\n  <label for=\"limesCheckbox\">Limes</label>\n\n</fieldset>\n</example>\n\n### Fully disabled checkbox\n\n* An input using the `disabled` attribute will not be focusable with the tab key\n* Arrow keys will still be able to browse disabled inputs\n\n```html\n<fieldset>\n  <legend>Choose your favorite video game</legend>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"marioCheckbox\" disabled checked>\n  <label for=\"marioCheckbox\">MarioKart</label>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zeldaCheckbox\" disabled>\n  <label for=\"zeldaCheckbox\">Legend of Zelda</label>\n\n</fieldset>\n```\n\n<example>\n<fieldset>\n  <legend>Choose your favorite video game</legend>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"marioCheckbox\" disabled checked>\n  <label for=\"marioCheckbox\">MarioKart</label>\n\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"zeldaCheckbox\" disabled>\n  <label for=\"zeldaCheckbox\">Legend of Zelda</label>\n\n</fieldset>\n</example>\n\n### When you can't use semantic HTML\n\nThis custom checkbox requires extra attributes and event listeners:\n\n```html\n<div role=\"checkbox\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-checked=\"true\">\n  Elmo\n</div>\n```\n\n### Speciality checkboxes\n\nSometimes a design may call for a card-type checkbox.\n\n* Its core should still be a semantic checkbox input\n* Use `aria-describedby` to read extra content *after* the the name, role, and state\n\n```html\n<ul class=\"cards\">\n  <li class=\"card interactive\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\"\n           id=\"oscarCheckboxCard\"\n           aria-describedby=\"descriptionOscar\" >\n    <label for=\"oscarCheckboxCard\">\n      Oscar the Grouch\n    </label>\n    <div class=\"extended-description\"\n         id=\"descriptionOscar\">\n

          aria-describedby=\"descriptionGrover\" >\n    <label for=\"groverCheckboxCard\">\n      Grover\n      </label>\n    <div class=\"extended-description\"\n         id=\"descriptionGrover\">\n      Grover is a self-described as lovable, cute, \n      and furry, he is a blue monster who rarely \n      uses contractions when he speaks or sings.\n    </div>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n<example>\n<ul class=\"cards\">\n  <li class=\"card interactive\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\"\n           id=\"oscarCheckboxCard\"\n           aria-describedby=\"descriptionOscar\" >\n    <label for=\"oscarCheckboxCard\">\n      Oscar the Grouch\n    </label>\n    <div class=\"extended-description\"\n         id=\"descriptionOscar\">\n

Developer notes\n\n### Name\n\n* The `label` text must describe the checkbox input\n* Use `aria-describedby=\"hint-id\"` for hints or additional descriptions\n* `aria-label=\"Checkbox input purpose\"` can also be used (as a last resort)\n\n### Role\n\n* **By default**, semantic HTML checkbox inputs identify as a checkbox\n* Use `role=\"checkbox\"` for custom elements\n\n### Group\n\n* Semantic HTML\n  * `<fieldset>` wraps a checkbox group\n  * `<legend>` describes the group's purpose\n  * Each `<label>` must include `for=\"input-id\"` to be associated with its input\n* Custom elements\n  * Use `role=\"group\"` in the place of fieldset\n  * Use `aria-labelledby=\"label-id\"` to associate an element as a label\n  * `aria-label=\"Group purpose\"` can also be used if there's no label with an `id`\n\n### State\n\n* Semantic HTML\n  * Use `checked` for native HTML\n  * Use the `disabled` state for inactive checkboxes\n* Custom element\n  * Use `aria-checked=\"true/false\"` to express state\n  * Use `aria-disabled=\"true\"` to declare inactive elements\n\n### Focus\n\n* Focus must be visible\n* Custom elements will require keyboard event listeners"

          "developerNotes": "## Decorative images\n\nThere are times that images shouldn't be read because it would be repetitive or not add any value in addition to the existing page content. These types of images are generally included for purely stylistic purposes and don't impart any meaning to the rest of the content on the page.\n\n## Is this image decorative or informative?\n\nIf the image conveys important meaning, and there's no other text on the page which explains the concept within it, then the image is likely informative. In this case, check out the [informative image checklist](/checklist-web/image) item instead.\n\n## Decorative images still require an alt attribute\n\n* To have valid HTML, the `alt` attribute must still be present, even when set to the empty empty value of `alt`. Note that `alt` and `alt=\"\"` (no space) are equivalent in HTML.\n  * When the `alt` attribute is empty, the screen reader ignores it (and will not read anything).\n  * When the `alt` attribute is missing, the screen reader will read the `src` name or filename of the image which is a very poor user experience.\n\n<example class=\"example example--contains-icon\">\n  <h3 class=\"h-charlie decorated\">\n    <img src=\"media/images/icons/icon-info.svg\" alt=\"\"> \n    Note: Your plan might be changing soon.\n  </h3>\n  <a href=\"tel:8888888888\" className=\"decorated\">\n    <img src=\"media/images/icons/icon-phone.svg\" class=\"icon\" alt=\"\">\n      Call us: 888-888-8888\n  </a>\n</example>\n\n```html\n<h3 class=\"h-charlie decorated\">\n  <img\n    src=\"media/images/icons/icon-info.svg\"\n    class=\"icon\"\n    alt=\"\" />\n  Note: Your plan might be changing soon.\n</h3>\n<a \n  href=\"tel:8888888888\"\n  class=\"decorated\">\n  <img \n    src=\"media/images/icons/icon-phone.svg\"\n    class=\"icon\"\n    alt=\"\" />\n    Call us: 888-888-8888\n</a>\n```\n\n## Using inline SVG\n\n### Inline SVG that is decorative\n\nInline SVGs require some special code to be hidden properly from screen readers:\n\n* `aria-hidden=\"true\"`\n\nIf you are using a `<use />` element, add `aria-hidden=\"true\"`.\n\n```html\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\">\n  <use href=\"#svg-id\" aria-hidden=\"true\" />\n  <!-- if not using <use> then the child elements \n       of the inline SVG would go here -->\n</svg>\n```\n\n## Further reading\n\n* This page owes a lot to this exhaustive blog post: [Contextually Marking up accessible images and SVGs by Scott O'Hara](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/05/22/contextual-images-svgs-and-a11y.html)\n* [W3C Image decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/)"

This attribute has very low and support and unpredictable output across screen readers.\n\n## Name\n\n* The modal window has a logical descriptive name from either:\n  * `aria-label=\"Modal title\"` or\n  * `aria-labelledby=\"heading-id\"` pointing to an `<h2>` as a title\n\n### Role\n\n* Use `role=\"dialog\"` so the screen reader can identify this as a dialog or modal.\n\n### Group\n\n* Upon closing, focus must return to the button that launched the dialog.\n\n### State\n\n* Use `aria-modal=\"true\"` to indicate content beneath the modal is inert and that the screen reader must not browse outside the dialog.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use `tabindex=\"-1\"` to make the modal itself targetable for focus.\n* Upon closing, focus must return to the button that launched the dialog.\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [Browser Support](https://caniuse.com/?search=dialog)\n\n## Screenreader differences\n\n### NVDA\n\n* By default, NVDA may read the entire modal upon launch. This is expected behavior.\n\n## Code examples\n\n### Use semantic HTML where possible\n\nSince browser support for `<dialog>` is incomplete, if you plan to use the `<dialog>` element we recommend that you include the `role=\"dialog\"` attribute because the element alone is not fully compatible.\n\nSome browsers require additional scripting.

For example, “Password is currently visible”.\n  * Avoid adding `aria-hidden=\"true\"` or CSS `display: none;` to the live region container that receives the dynamic update as this may impact screen reader support.\n  * Ensure the dynamic text, that is added to the live region, is removed from the DOM after a short amount of time so screen reader users do not encounter this text while navigating beyond the form field.\n\n```html\n<form class=\"password-container button-variant\" data-show-password=\"false\" onsubmit=\"return false;\">\n    <label for=\"password-b\">\n      Password\n

</custom-element>  \n</div>\n```\n\n## Specialty use cases\n\n### Radio mixed with interactive elements\n\n**Avoid** this pattern when possible! Radio groups are not supposed to consist of nested interactive elements. Radio button focus order is not what you may expect.\n\n* By default, it is not expected behavior that each radio button can be tabbed to. This is how radio buttons naturally behave\n\n* As soon as a radio button is selected, the selected radio input receives focus first from the group. As a result screen reader users may not discover a nested control for an option if they start switching between radio buttons alone\n\n* To try to mitigate screen reader users not discovering the nested controls, describe the fieldset / radiogroup with non-visual text. This can be done with <code>aria-describedby</code> on the <code>fieldset</code>. For example, \"Edit controls are available which follow each radio button\"\n\n* Ensure the nested controls also have additional context defined by <code>aria-describedby</code>. This will help screen reader users understand their purpose.\n\n* Use of the same <code>name</code> attribute is important to link the radio buttons as a programmatic group\n\n* Keyboard functionality such as arrow up/down/left/right should change the selected radio button.\n\n```html\n<fieldset class=\"checkbox-radio-group\" aria-describedby=\"styled-radio-group-helper-text\">\n  <legend>Choose your payment method:</legend>\n  <!-- Visually hidden helper text describing fieldset -->\n  <!-- This text should only be present in the DOM if the radio group has nested controls.

A `<select>` does everything that the stepper input does, and with less code. Additionally, a `<select>` is a native HTML component and inherently accessible.\n\nThe stepper input component is useful for *small range increments*. If the max character count is more than 20, consider use of a [text Input](https://www.magentaa11y.com/MagentaA11yV2#/web-criteria/component/text-input/) field as this component will be cumbersome for people using a mouse.\n\n```html\n<div>\n  <label for=\"stepper\">\n    Quantity\n  </label>\n  <div class=\"stepper\">\n      <button class=\"button minus\" aria-label=\"Decrease Quantity\" aria-disabled=\"true\"></button>\n      <select id=\"stepper\"\n               name=\"stepper-input\"\n               min=\"1\"\n               max=\"11\"\n               data-selected=\"1\">\n         <option value=\"1\" selected>1</option>\n         <option value=\"2\">2</option>\n         <option value=\"3\">3</option>\n         <option value=\"4\">4</option>\n         <option value=\"5\">5</option>\n         <option value=\"6\">6</option>\n         <option value=\"7\">7</option>\n         <option value=\"8\">8</option>\n         <option value=\"9\">9</option>\n         <option value=\"10\">10</option>\n         <option value=\"11\">11</option>\n      </select>\n      <button class=\"button plus\" aria-label=\"Increase Quantity\"></button>\n   </div>\n  <!-- live container where \"Quantity updated, [number]\" will be dynamically updated -->\n  <div aria-live=\"polite\" class=\"hidden\" id=\"stepper-status-target\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\n<!-- TODO disabling buttons -->\n\n<example>\n   <div>\n      <label for=\"stepper\">\n         Quantity\n      </label>\n      <div class=\"stepper\">\n            <button data-fn=\"decreaseSelectStepper\" data-icon=\"minus\" class=\"button minus\" aria-label=\"Decrease Quantity\" aria-disabled=\"true\"></button>\n            <select id=\"stepper\"\n                     name=\"stepper-input\"\n                     min=\"1\"\n                     max=\"11\"\n                     data-selected=\"1\">\n               <option value=\"1\" selected>1</option>\n               <option value=\"2\">2</option>\n               <option value=\"3\">3</option>\n               <option value=\"4\">4</option>\n               <option value=\"5\">5</option>\n               <option value=\"6\">6</option>\n               <option value=\"7\">7</option>\n               <option value=\"8\">8</option>\n               <option value=\"9\">9</option>\n               <option value=\"10\">10</option>\n               <option value=\"11\">11</option>\n            </select>\n            <button data-fn=\"increaseSelectStepper\" data-icon=\"plus\" class=\"button plus\" aria-label=\"Increase Quantity\"></button>\n         </div>\n      <!-- live container where \"Quantity updated, [number]\" will be dynamically updated -->\n      <div aria-live=\"polite\" class=\"hidden\" id=\"stepper-status-target-1\"></div>\n   </div>\n</example>\n\n### No-select stepper\n\n* Uses buttons to increment/decrement\n* Has an updating `aria-live` region to provide updates\n* Buttons should be disabled when the stepper hits its minimum or maximum value.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"stepper\">\n   <button id=\"decrement-button\" data-fn=\"decreaseNumber\" data-icon=\"minus\" class=\"button minus\" aria-label=\"Decrease Quantity\" aria-disabled=\"true\"></button>\n   <span id=\"step-number\">0</span>\n   <button data-icon=\"plus\"  data-fn=\"increaseNumber\" class=\"button plus\" aria-label=\"Increase Quantity\"></button>\n   <!-- live container where \"Quantity updated, [number]\" will be dynamically updated -->\n   <div aria-live=\"polite\" class=\"hidden\" id=\"stepper-status-target\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\n<!-- TODO disabling buttons -->\n\n<example>\n   <div class=\"stepper\">\n      <button id=\"decrement-button\" data-fn=\"decreaseNumber\" data-icon=\"minus\" class=\"button minus\" aria-label=\"Decrease Quantity\" aria-disabled=\"true\"></button>\n      <span id=\"step-number\">0</span>\n      <button data-icon=\"plus\"  data-fn=\"increaseNumber\" class=\"button plus\" aria-label=\"Increase Quantity\"></button>\n      <!-- live container where \"Quantity updated, [number]\" will be dynamically updated -->\n      <div aria-live=\"polite\" class=\"hidden\" id=\"stepper-status-target\"></div>\n   </div>\n</example>\n\n## Developer notes\n\n* This stepper example provides both `button` and `select` elements for users to change a value.\n\n* A non-visual live container with `aria-live=\"polite\"` is present in the DOM on page load. When the `button` element is activated, this non-visual live container is updated with dynamic content that screen reader users will hear announced as they increment or decrement the value. This dynamic text is then removed from the DOM after a few seconds (but not the actual container with `aria-live=\"polite\"`) so the message is not discovered by screen reader users after interaction. The content of this message dynamically created based on the `label` for the `select` and the current value of the `select`, e.g. \"Quantity updated, 4\".\n\n* The value of the `select` element naturally communicates the updated value to screen reader users so the live container is not updated when interacting with that form element.\n\n* The `button` and `aria-label` values should be plain text and should include context of what they affect when activated (typically the label for the `select`), e.g. \"Increase Quantity\" or \"Add Quantity\".\n\n* The buttons will need `aria-disabled=\"true\"` applied when either end of the range is reached.\n\n* Related alternative patterns: [Select dropdown](https://www.magentaa11y.com/MagentaA11yV2#/web-criteria/component/select/) or an [WAI-ARIA Spin Button](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/spinbutton/examples/datepicker-spinbuttons/)."

          "developerNotes": "## Tab groups\n\nTabs can be useful in scenarios where content is repetitive and doesn't require direct comparison. In these instances, they can effectively organize information without compromising functionality. When implemented thoughtfully, tabs can enhance accessibility by simplifying navigation and helping users quickly locate the information they need.\n\nHowever, tab groups can also pose challenges for accessibility and usability when not implemented effectively. Poorly designed tab groups often lead to a cluttered presentation of content, which can detract from the overall user experience rather than enhance it. Ensuring that tab groups are thoughtfully structured is crucial for making content more accessible and user-friendly.\n\n### Potential issues with tab groups:\n\n* **Accessibility**: Many screen reader users struggle with navigating tab groups using arrow keys, potentially missing crucial content.\n* **Interaction Rates**: Engagement is typically low for content beyond the first tab panel.\n* **Visibility of Content**: Content is hidden by default, and not all users are aware of how to access it.\n* **Comparative Information**: Users cannot easily compare information presented across multiple tabs.\n\n### Recommended alternatives:\n\nInstead of using tab groups, consider these alternatives:\n\n* Breaking the page into clear sections with concise copywriting.\n* Use expandable sections (accordions) for better organization.\n* Create separate pages for different topics\n\n### Tab activation types:\n\nTabs can be built to be activated **automatically** or **manually**.\n\n* **Automatic** tabs become activated immediately upon focus via a mouse click or the arrow keys.\n* **Manual** tabs can receive focus via the arrow keys, but require the user to press either `Enter` or `Space`, or click them with their mouse to activate them.\n\nYou can find additional guidance as well as examples of automatic and manually activated tab groups on the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide Tabs Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/) page.\n\n### Code considerations\n\n* **Tablist**: The main container for tabs requires `role=\"tablist\"`.\n* **Tabs**: Each tab within the `tablist` requires `role=\"tab\"`.\n* **Content Panels**: Each content area for a tab is called a `role=\"tabpanel\"`.\n* **Labels**: Each `tabpanel` needs to have an `aria-labelledby` attribute that points to the corresponding `tab` label.\n* **Control Association**: Each `tab` has an `aria-controls` attribute linking it to its corresponding `tabpanel`.\n* **Active Tab**: The currently selected tab has `aria-selected` set to true; all other tabs have it set to false.\n* **Orientation**: If the tablist is vertical, it has `aria-orientation` set to vertical. By default, it is horizontal.\n\n### Code Example\n\n```html\n<div class=\"tabs\">\n  <div role=\"tablist\">\n    <button role=\"tab\"\n            aria-selected=\"true\" \n            aria-controls=\"alpha-tab\" \n            id=\"alpha\">\n            Alpha\n    </button>\n    <button role=\"tab\" \n            aria-selected=\"false\" \n            aria-controls=\"bravo-tab\" \n            id=\"bravo\" \n            tabindex=\"-1\">\n            Bravo\n    </button>\n    <button role=\"tab\" \n            aria-selected=\"false\" \n            aria-controls=\"charlie-tab\" \n            id=\"charlie\" \n            tabindex=\"-1\">\n            Charlie\n    </button>\n  </div>\n  <div role=\"tabpanel\" \n       id=\"alpha-tab\" \n       aria-labelledby=\"alpha\"\n       tabindex=\"0\">\n    <p>Alpha is the first letter of the NATO alphabet</p>\n  </div>\n  <div role=\"tabpanel\" \n       id=\"bravo-tab\" \n       aria-labelledby=\"bravo\"\n       tabindex=\"0\">\n    <p>Bravo is the second letter of the NATO alphabet</p>\n  </div>\n  <div role=\"tabpanel\" \n       id=\"charlie-tab\" \n       aria-labelledby=\"charlie\"\n       tabindex=\"0\">\n    <p>Charlie is the third letter of the NATO alphabet</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```"

          "developerNotes": "## Rethinking Toast Snackbars\n\nToast snackbars might seem like an easy way to provide feedback, but they’re often not the best fit for accessible and user-friendly design. Here’s why:\n\n* Accessibility Limitations: Because snackbars are custom HTML elements, they lack semantic meaning and can be challenging for assistive technologies like screen readers.\n* Missed Messages: If a user doesn’t catch a snackbar in time, it’s difficult to go back and review the information.\n* Auditory Clutter: For screen readers, snackbars can create unnecessary noise, especially if they appear frequently or unexpectedly.\n* Unclear Rules: Like tooltips, snackbars are tricky to define and test consistently in design criteria.\n\n### Instead use an inline element to indicate a change\n\n* Inline Feedback: Inject a success message *in proximity* to the updated control\n* Accessible Undo/Redo Options: Place these buttons in clear, easy-to-navigate locations.\n* Thoughtful Confirmations: Use a confirmation screen for critical actions or when users are exiting an important flow.\n\n<!-- TODO: Needs JS support to activate the toast!\n\n<example>\n<fieldset>\n  <legend>Marketing preferences</legend>\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" role=\"switch\" id=\"spam\" aria-describedby=\"hint-spam-message\" checked=\"\">\n  <label for=\"spam\">\n   Send me constant spam\n   </label>\n  <div id=\"hint-spam\" role=\"alert\" class=\"alert notification inert\">\n    <div id=\"hint-spam-message\">\n      - Use JS to inject the alert here (comment out in the future)\n    </div>     \n  </div>\n</fieldset>\n</example> -->\n\n### When Toast Snackbars Don’t Work:\n\nThere are certain scenarios where snackbars simply aren’t the right tool:\n\n* Critical or Irreversible Actions: For example, “Unsend this message” or “Confirm payment.” These require deliberate, visible feedback\n* Blocking Error Messages: Important errors should grab attention and provide clear guidance—not rely on a fleeting message.\n* Page-Load Alerts: Automatically showing messages on page load can confuse users, particularly those using screen readers.\n\n### Timing\n\nIf you find a situation where a toast snackbar is truly necessary:\n\n* Avoid auto-dismiss wherever possible.\n* If dismissal must be automatic, make sure the [timing is adjustable to meet WCAG 2.2.1 standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/timing-adjustable.html).\n\n## Only use toast snackbars to *reinforce* updates\n\n* If using a snackbar is unavoidable, it must only be used for non-critical messaging.\n* The status injected must also be discernable on the page *without the snackbar*.\n\n### Practical example\n\nGiven that I am on a dynamic single page application\n\n* WHEN the customer changes the state of a toggle to OFF or ON\n  * THEN the toast appears to *reinforce* that the change has been saved\n  * AND the customer can confirm this is true from the toggle itself\n\n## Code example\n\n```html\n<div id=\"toast\">\n  <span id=\"toast-message\" role=\"status\">\n    <!-- Inject snackbar message here -->\n  </span>\n  <button type=\"button\">\n    Dismiss\n  </button>\n</div>\n```"

          "developerNotes": "## Building accessible forms\n\n### Do not auto focus inputs\n\n* Automatically moving focus to an input field is very confusing for people using assistive technology.\n\n### Group inputs\n\nUse `fieldset` and `legend` to group related fields, such as:\n\n* Sign in\n* Shipping address\n* Payment information\n\n### Error handling\n\n* Individual inputs must have [programmatically described errors](https://www.magentaa11y.com/checklist-web/hint-help-error/) read by the screen reader on focus.\n* For long forms, list all errors in an [alert](https://www.magentaa11y.com/checklist-web/alert/) with links back to each invalid input on submission attempts.\n\n## UX guidance\n\n### Affordance: field width indicates the expected input\n\nForm field width should afford the user space to enter the characters that will be required. Do not arbitrarily limit the width of names, usernames, passwords or emails.\n\nPractical Examples\n\n* Middle initial should be wide enough to accommodate 1 character\n* State abbreviations should be wide enough to accommodate 2 characters\n* Zip code must be wide enough to accommodate 5 characters\n* Pin numbers reflect the number of digits expected\n\n### Why we stack inputs\n\nDo not put forms in multiple columns.\n\n* People are accustomed to scrolling vertically. There is no advantage to making the page take up less vertical space.\n* People with low vision may be using a zoom tool, enlarging the view of their screen and thus only seeing a portion of the form. If there is a column on the right side, it will be difficult to discover the fields.\n* Do not place submit buttons in a sidebar unless there is also a submit button at the bottom of the form\n\n### Why we use autocomplete\n\n* Utilizing [autocomplete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/autocomplete) allows users automated assistance in filling out form field values.\n* Autocomplete is helpful for all customers leading to a speedier conversion\n* For those with motor disabilities, it eliminates the need to laboriously enter information\n\n## Code examples\n\n### Use semantic HTML\n\n```html\n<form aria-label=\"Sign in\">\n  <fieldset>\n    <legend>Sign in</legend>\n    <label for=\"username\">Username</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\">\n    <button type=\"submit\">Sign in</button>\n  </fieldset>\n</form>\n```\n\n<example>\n    <form aria-label=\"Sign in\">\n      <fieldset>\n        <legend>Sign in</legend>\n        <label for=\"username\">Username</label>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\">\n        <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary\" type=\"submit\">Sign in</button>\n      </fieldset>\n    </form>\n</example>\n\n### Credit card information\n\nUse `fieldset` and `legend` to group related fields, such as:\n\n* This form uses minimal unobtrusive masking to make the credit card number more readable. (When done poorly, masking can can cause the field to be read repeatedly as the mask refreshes)\n* Autofill attributes to help customers complete fields with less effort.\n* Using `inputmode=\"numeric\"` brings up the numeric keyboard on mobile devices making entry easier.\n\n```html\n<form aria-label=\"Payment information\">\n  <fieldset>\n    <legend>\n      Enter your

In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' `contentDescription` or names, one after the other, in a single announcement.\n\n#### Jetpack Compose\n\n* `Modifier.semantics(mergeDescendants = true) {}` is equivalent to `importantForAccessibility` when compared to android views\n* `FocusRequester.createRefs()` helps to request focus to inner elements with in the group\n\n***\n\n### State\n\n#### Android Views\n\n* Active: `android:enabled=true`\n* Disabled: `android:enabled=false`.

Alt text on the image that describes its purpose.\n  2. Name describes the purpose of the control and matches any visible text in image\n  3. Programmatic name of each interactive component in audio challenge is announced\n\n#### **Android Views**\n\n* `android:text` XML attribute\n* Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name, depending on type of view and for elements (icons) without a visible label\n* `contentDescription` overrides `android:text`\n* Use `labelFor` attribute to associate any visible label with the control\n\n#### **Jetpack Compose**\n\n* Compose uses semantics properties to pass information to accessibility services.\n* The built-in Button composable will fill the semantics properties with information inferred from the composable by default.\n* Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name to override the default visible label of the button text.\n* Example specification of contentDescription in compose: `modifier = Modifier.semantics { contentDescription = \"\" }`\n\n### Role\n\n* Experiences (refer to number above):\n  1. Identifies as an image\n  2. Identifies as an image button\n  3. Each interactive component in audio challenge identifies as a button or edit box\n\n#### **Android Views**\n\n* When not using native controls (ie, custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n* Standard button or ImageButton\n\n#### **Jetpack Compose**\n\n* Standard `Button` composable\n\n### Groupings\n\n#### **Android Views**\n\n* `ViewGroup`\n* Set the container object's `android:screenReaderFocusable` attribute to true, and each inner object's `android:focusable` attribute to false. In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' `contentDescription` or names, one after the other, in a single announcement.\n\n#### **Jetpack Compose**\n\n* `Modifier.semantics(mergeDescendants = true) {}` is equivalent to `importantForAccessibility` when compared to android views\n* `FocusRequester.createRefs()` helps to request focus to inner elements with in the group\n\n### State\n\n* Experiences (refer to number above):\n  1. If grouped in table row, it's possible for the whole row to have a disabled state, or the captcha button disabled separately\n  2. Image button can have a disabled state (disabled)\n  3.

Announcement: disabled\n\n#### **Jetpack Compose**\n\n* Active: default state is active and enabled. Use `Button(enabled = true)` to specify explicitly\n* Disabled: `Button(enabled = false)` announces as disabled\n* Alternatively can use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { disabled() }` to announce as disabled\n* Use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { stateDescription = \"\" }` to have a customized state announcement\n\n### Focus\n\n* Experiences (refer to number above):\n  1. Focus is on the whole table row. There should be no focus on any single element, if the whole table row is grouped together, as long as there is only one interactive element per row.\n  2. The image button receives focus by swipe or touch\n  3. Each element in audio challenge receives focus by swipe or touch. User is confined inside a modal, if presented\n* Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place (back button, screen title, first text field, first heading)\n\n#### **Android Views**\n\n* `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API\n* `android:focusable`\n* `android=clickable`\n* Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`\n* `nextFocusDown`\n* `nextFocusUp`\n* `nextFocusRight`\n* `nextFocusLeft`\n* `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)\n* To hide controls: `importantForAccessibility=false`\n* For a `ViewGroup`, set `screenReaderFocusable=true` and each inner object’s attribute to keyboard focus (`focusable=false`)\n\n#### **Jetpack Compose**\n\n* `Modifier.focusTarget()` makes the component focusable\n* `Modifier.focusOrder()` needs to be used in combination with FocusRequesters to define focus order\n* `Modifier.onFocusEvent()`, `Modifier.onFocusChanged()` can be used to observe the changes to focus state\n* `FocusRequester` allows to request focus to individual elements with in a group of merged descendant views\n* Example: To customize the focus events\n  * step 1: define the focus requester prior. `val (first, second) = FocusRequester.createRefs()`\n  * step 2: update the modifier to set the order. `modifier = Modifier.focusOrder(first) { this.down = second }`\n  * focus order accepts following values: up, down, left, right, previous, next, start, end\n  * step 3: use `second.requestFocus()` to gain focus\n\n### Custom Accessibility Action\n\n* When UI elements are customized and coded to look like a specific component say button, to ensure that name, role, state and action are all intact might need to update accessibility service and semantics.\n* Disclaimer: This customization would not be needed unless it is required to modify/add gestures or actions.\n* The Button class by default supplies all the necessary semantics to make it fully accessible.\n\n#### **Android Views**\n\n* step 1: Create an accessibility service\n* step 2: Add the `FLAG_REQUEST_ACCESSIBILITY_BUTTON` flag in an AccessibilityServiceInfo object's `android:accessibilityFlags` attribute\n* step 3: To have a custom service register for the button's custom action callbacks, use `registerAccessibilityButtonCallback()`\n\n#### **Jetpack Compose**\n\n* List of custom accessibility actions can be defined relatively easily in compose compared to Views using customActions.\n* Example: `modifier = Modifier.semantics { customActions = listOf(CustomAccessibilityAction(label = \"\", action = { true }))}`",

Buttons in audio challenge can have a disabled state (dimmed)\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n* For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n  * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the button to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the button.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* For selected, use `accessibilityAddTraits(.isSelected)`\n* For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`\n\n### Focus\n\n* Experiences (refer to number above):\n  1.

At least one of the options in the above success criteria for navigating through the elements/slides must be available\n* Slides cannot automatically start rotating through carousel unless there is a pause/stop button\n* Consider the number of slides/elements in carousel when choosing implementation.  Swiping right through the slides of a very large number of slides to get to the next element past the carousel would not be a good user experience.\n* The container around the carousel on Android can be an alternative for the user to bypass all the slides.  The user can enter the container to navigate through the slides, or swipe to the next element past the container.\n  * When navigating to a carousel with the screen reader, it should first focus on the entire carousel container\n  * Each carousel may have a different number of items, so the label includes the total amount of items and the current item in focus\n  * Then, activating the carousel container focuses on the first carousel item\n  * Two finger swipe rt or left navigates through the slides putting focus on the next slide in the order\n* Alternate implementation to swiping through carousel: Change the slides with interactive page control dots and dynamically announce all the content in the slide along with page index (without focus on slides, just on the dots)\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name of any interactive element describes it's purpose.\n\n* Each item in the carousel, if interactive, has a name that describes the purpose of the control and matches any visible label/all text and image descriptions within item.\n\n* **Android View**\n  * `android:text` XML attribute\n  * Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name, depending on type of view and for elements without a visible label.\n  * `contentDescription` overrides `android:text`\n  * Use `labelFor` attribute to associate the visible label to the control\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n  * If no visible label, use compose modifier semantics `contentDescription`.\n  * If any icons or images need to be hidden for accessibility talkback, use compose modifier semantics `invisibleToUser()`\n\n### Role\n\n* The native Pager component will handle the built-in accessibility behavior\n\n* Each item in the carousel can have the independent role and accessibility trait. For example, if the item is clickable, the role should be `button`.\n\n* **Android View**\n  * ViewPager\n  * CarouselView\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n  * Compose foundation `HorizontalPager` and `VerticalPager`\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group visible label with the carousel, if applicable.\n* Group the title and any description with each item in the carousel\n* If the item in carousel is clickable, use compose modifier `clickable` which will group the child elements automatically.\n* If the item in carousel has multi-actions, then spilt the action out of the group with proper focus order on each actions.\n* **Android View**\n  * `ViewGroup`\n  * Set the container object's `android:screenReaderFocusable` attribute to true, and each inner object's `android:focusable` attribute to false.

At least one of the options in the above success criteria for navigating through the elements/slides must be available\n* Slides cannot automatically start rotating through carousel unless there is a pause/stop button\n* Consider the number of slides/elements in carousel when choosing implementation.  Swiping right through the slides of a very large number of slides to get to the next element past the carousel would not be a good user experience. Custom actions/gestures for navigation through the slides should be considered on large carousels on iOS.  Then, if the user wants to bypass all the slides, they would simply swipe right to the next element past the carousel\n* Alternate implementation to swiping through carousel: Change the slides with interactive page control dots and dynamically announce all the content in the slide along with page index (without focus on slides, only on the dots)\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name of any interactive element describes it's purpose\n\n* Append \", Carousel\" to the programmatic name to announce the role, since the carousel is custom and does not have a native role assigned\n\n* If visible text label exists for an interactive component, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognization.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n    * The carousel's title will overwrite the carousel's `accessibilityLabel`.\n  * If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the carousel's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n    * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n  * If button has icon(s), hide the icon(s) from VoiceOver by using view modifier `accessibilityHidden(true)`.\n\n### Role\n\n* Since there is no native carousel component, a custom carousel must be implemented.\n\n* The carousel itself has its own role indicated by appending \", Carousel\" to the programmatic name.\n\n* Each item in the carousel has its own independent role or accessibility trait. For example, if the item is interactive, the role will be `.button`.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * A common method of implementing a carousel involves using `UICollectionView` and its corresponding protocols. Each item of the carousel is a `UICollectionViewCell`.\n  * Set the `accessibilityTraits` of the overall carousel role to `.adjustable`, and then append \", Carousel\" to the programmatic name to notify the user of the role\n  * An individual item of the carousel will have its own role that is dependent on whether it is interactive. Assign the role that best fits your use case.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * As there are different ways to implement a carousel, use your best judgment for your use case.\n  * Append \", Carousel\" to the programmatic name for the overall carousel\n  * An individual item of the carousel will have its own role that is dependent on whether it is interactive. Assign the role that best fits your use case.\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityAddTraits(:)` to add traits.\n  * If applicable, use view modifier `accessibilityRemoveTraits(:)` to remove unwanted traits.\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group visible label with the carousel, if applicable.\n\n* Group the title and any description with each item in the carousel.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n    * If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n      * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n### State\n\n* Indicate where the item is in the carousel by announcing the position/index out of the total number of items. (see Announcements below)\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Custom Gestures\n\n* The expected experience is that when users swipe left or right, they are navigating from one section of the screen to another. When users swipe up or down on the carousel, the user is scrolling through the carousel\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * First, ensure that the accessibility trait of the carousel is `.adjustable`.\n  * Then, you are able to take advantage of the `accessibilityIncrement` and `accessibilityDecrement` methods\n\n  ```swift\n  override func accessibilityIncrement() {\n      // Move forward one item\n\n  }\n\n  override func accessibilityDecrement() {\n      // Move backward one item\n\n  }\n  ```\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * There are many approaches to applying custom gestures to a component\n  * One suggestion is to use `.accessibilityAdjustableAction` with a `switch` statement for the `direction`, and changing the index of the cell depending on whether the direction is `.increment` or `.decrement`\n\n    * \"Incrementing\" should move to the next item\n    * \"Decrementing\" should move to the previous item\n\n    ```swift\n    .accessibilityAdjustableAction { direction in\n        switch direction {\n        case .increment:\n            // Go to next page\n\n        case .decrement:\n            // Go to previous page\n\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n### Announcements\n\n* “Showing slides x of y” are common announcements to give screen readers context of layout\n* “Custom actions available.  Swipe up or down to change slides” – common custom actions announcement",

It should not automatically navigate the user to another field or screen when activated, as that may cause a change of context. Revealing new information on the same screen as a result of activating a checkbox is usually ok, as it is not a change of context.\n* Name, Role, State must be announced when focus is on the control. Announcing the label only in a separate swipe before the checkbox does not meet this requirement.\n\n#### Code example\n\n```java\nval checkedState = remember { mutableStateOf(true) }\nval stateNotSubscribed = \"Not Selected\"\nval stateSubscribed = \"Selected\"\nRow(\n  modifier = Modifier\n        .semantics {\n            stateDescription = if (checkedState.value) { stateSubscribed } else { stateNotSubscribed }\n            contentDescription = \"Subscribe\"\n        }\n        .toggleable(\n            value = checkedState.value,\n            onValueChange = { checkedState.value = it },\n            role = Role.Checkbox\n        )\n  ) {\n    Checkbox(\n            modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.CenterVertically),\n            checked = checkedState.value,\n            onCheckedChange = null\n    )\n        Text(text = \"Subscription\")\n    }\n```\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name describes the purpose of the control\n\n* Programmatic name matches the visible text label\n\n* **Android Views**\n  * `android:text` XML attribute\n  * Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name, depending on type of view and for elements (icons) without a visible label\n  * `contentDescription` overrides `android:text`\n  * Use `labelFor` attribute to associate the visible label with the control (best practice)\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n  * By default, the simple checkbox composable is readout & focused separately from its label text, which makes it hard to understand the context.\n  * Use `Row` composable and `toggleable(role = Role.Checkbox)` with inner element as `Checkbox` composable (recommended practice) to have entire row including its label focused for selection, so it allows screenreader to read the name and role together.\n  * Optional: use `Modifier.semantics {  contentDescription = \"\" }` for a more descriptive name\n\n### Role\n\n* When not using native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n* **Android Views**\n  * CheckBox Class\n  * Announced as \"checkbox\"\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n  * Simple checkbox composable.\n  * Alternatively use checkbox composable in combination with `Row` and `toggleable(role = Role.Checkbox)`. Code example above.\n  * Announced as \"checkbox\"\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group visible label with button (if applicable) to provide a programmatic name for the button\n\n* **Android Views**\n  * ViewGroup\n  * Set the container object's `android:screenReaderFocusable` attribute to true, and each inner object's `android:focusable` attribute to false. In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' `contentDescription` or names, one after the other, in a single announcement.\n  * use `labelFor`\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n  * `Modifier.semantics(mergeDescendants = true) {}` is equivalent to importantForAccessibility when compared to android views.\n  * To allow checkbox grouping, specify `onCheckedChange = null` on inner simple checkbox composable when combined with `Row` composable and `toggleable(value = checkedState.value, onValueChange = { checkedState.value = it })`. This makes the entire row group selectable including its label.\n  * `FocusRequester` can be used to request focus to individual components with in the group. More on FocusRequester in the focus section below.\n\n### State\n\n* When native code is not available for a state, add the state to the programmatic name (label).  Add logic when needed.\n\n* **Android Views**\n  * Active: `android:enabled=true`, `isChecked`, `setChecked`\n  * Disabled: `android:enabled=false` announced as: \"disabled\"\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n  * Checked: `Checkbox(checked = true)` announced as: \"checked\"\n  * Enabled:  `Checkbox(enabled = true)`\n  * Disabled: `Checkbox(enabled = false)` announced as: \"disabled\"\n  * When using checkbox composable with row and toggleable, need to specify `Modifier.toggleable(enabled = false)` along with `Checkbox(enabled = false)`\n  * Use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { stateDescription = \"\" }` to have a customized state announcement.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes needs focus management\n\n* **Android Views**\n  * `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API\n  * `android:focusable`\n  * `android=clickable`\n  * Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`\n  * `nextFocusDown`\n  * `nextFocusUp`\n  * `nextFocusRight`\n  * `nextFocusLeft`\n  * `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)\n  * To hide controls: `Important_For_Accessibility_false`\n  * For a `ViewGroup`, set `screenReaderFocusable=true` and each inner object’s attribute to keyboard focus (`focusable=false`)\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n  * `Modifier.focusTarget()` makes the component focusable\n  * `Modifier.focusOrder()` needs to be used in combination with FocusRequesters to define focus order\n  * `Modifier.onFocusEvent()`, `Modifier.onFocusChanged()` can be used to observe the changes to focus state\n  * `FocusRequester` allows to request focus to individual elements with in a group of merged descendant views\n  * *Example:* To customize the focus events behaviour\n    * step 1: define the focus requester prior. `val (first, second) = FocusRequester.createRefs()`\n    * step 2: update the modifier to set the order. `modifier = Modifier.focusOrder(first) { this.down = second }`\n    * focus order accepts following values: up, down, left, right, previous, next, start, end\n    * step 3: use `second.requestFocus()` to gain focus\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* \"Checked, label, checkbox, double tap to toggle\"\n* \"Not checked, label, checkbox, double tap to toggle\"",

Announcing the label only in a separate swipe before the checkbox does not meet this requirement\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name describes the purpose of the control.\n\n* If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognization.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n    * The checkbox's title will overwrite the checkbox's `accessibilityLabel`.\n  * If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the button's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n    * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * By default, the visible label of a Toggle is the accessibility label\n  * If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n\n### Role\n\n* When using non-native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * Since there is no native checkbox in UIKit, implementing a custom checkbox may be necessary using `UIButton`, `UISwitch`, `UIControl`, or another class.\n    * Extend from one of the UIKit native controls above. A common control for custom checkboxes to extend from is the `UIButton`, but choose the native control that best fits your use case.\n    * Provide your own checked and unchecked checkbox images\n    * Implement action handlers for your custom checkbox\n    * Set accessibility properties accordingly\n  * If necessary, set `accessibilityTraits` to `.button`. Be sure to set the accessibility value to either \"Checked\" or \"Unchecked\" to indicate that this control behaves as a checkbox.\n  * An alternative to setting the accessibility trait to `.button` is removing and hiding the accessibility trait using `accessibilityTraits.remove(:)`. Then, append \", Checkbox\" to the programmatic name\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * Use native `Toggle` view with `toggleStyle(.checkbox)`\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group visible label with checkbox, if applicable, to provide a programmatic name for the checkbox.\n\n* Group the units such that the label, role, and state of the checkbox is announced in a single announcement.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n  * If frame does not exist, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n    * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n  * If the tap gesture is removed due to grouping logic, restore the tap gesture functionality using bindings to bind the tap gesture of the container with the state of the checkbox.\n\n### State\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * For checked state: Set `accessibilityValue` to \"Checked\"\n  * For unchecked state: Optionally, set `accessibilityValue` to \"Unchecked\"\n  * For enabled state: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n  * For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the button to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the button.\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * For checked state, if necessary: Set accessibility value to \"Checked\" with `accessibility(:)`\n  * For unchecked state, if necessary: Set accessibility value to \"Unchecked\" with `accessibilityValue(:)`\n  * For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* Appending checkbox to label:\n* \"Label checkbox, checked, button\"\n* \"Label checkbox, not checked, button\"  (not checked or \"unselected\" are acceptable)\n* Not appending to label:\n* \"Label, checked, button\"\n* \"Label, not checked, button\"  (both \"not checked\" or \"unselected\" are acceptable)",

If the chips are selectable as FilterChip or InputChip, the role is checkbox\n  **Android Views**\n  * Material `Chip`\n    **Jetpack Compose**\n  * `AssistChip`, `ElevatedAssistChip`\n  * `FilterChip`, `ElevatedFilterChip`\n  * `InputChip`\n  * `SuggestionChip`, `ElevatedSuggestionChip`\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Sometimes a visible label is provided.  Associate or group label with chip to provide a programmatic name\n\n**Android Views**\n\n* `ViewGroup`\n* Set the container object's `android:screenReaderFocusable` attribute to true, and each inner object's `android:focusable` attribute to false.

          "iosDeveloperNotes": "There is no native dropdown element for iOS.  The notes below are suggestions and accessibility guidance.\n\n### General Notes\n\n* A dropdown is a button that opens a list of options.  When an option is chosen, it displays in the field as the value\n* The difference between a menu and dropdown is a menu item performs an action when activated.  A dropdown item only replaces the current option\n* The screen reader focus moves directly to first option in dropdown upon double tapping the dropdown button and is confined in the list.\n* Sometimes, a hidden \"dismiss context menu\" button after the last item is available to close it.\n* Focus should go back to the triggering dropdown button, displaying the new option\n* There must be a visible label for the dropdown field that is not a placeholder and it describes the purpose of the dropdown.\n* The screen reader focus also remains confined in the dropdown list\n* The state of expanded or collapsed should be announced\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name describes the purpose of the control.\n\n* If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognition\n\n* When naming a button, do not add \"button\" to the programmatic name (label). Assigning \"Button\" as the role will handle this announcement.\n  * **Incorrect announcement:** \"Submit button, Button\"\n  * **Correct announcement:** \"Submit, Button\"\n\n* Placeholder or value text is NOT the programmatic name\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n    * The button’s title will overwrite the button’s `accessibilityLabel`.\n  * If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the button's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n    * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n  * To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n  * If button has icon(s), hide the icon(s) from VoiceOver by using view modifier `accessibilityHidden(true)`.\n\n### Role\n\n* When using non-native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n* One option is to use a table view and a button inside a UIStackView\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * Use `UIButton`\n  * If necessary, set `accessibilityTraits` to `.button`.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * Use native `Button` view\n  * If necessary, use view modifier `accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)` to assign the role as Button.\n  * If applicable, use view modifier `accessibilityRemoveTraits(:)` to remove unwanted traits.\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group visible label with button, if applicable, to provide a programmatic name for the button.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n  * Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n    * If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n      * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n    * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n### State\n\n* In the case of expandable dropdowns, state of the dropdown must be announced (i.e. expanded/collapsed). Add logic and announcements to the programmatic name for the state.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * If applicable, dropdown items should be announced whether they are selected/unselected, in the cases of radio buttons or checkboxes.\n  * For enabled dropdown items: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n  * For disabled dropdown items: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the dropdown item to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the dropdown item.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * If applicable, dropdown items should be announced whether they are selected/unselected, in the cases of radio buttons or checkboxes.\n  * For selected dropdown items, use `accessibilityAddTraits(.isSelected)`.\n  * For disabled dropdown items, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading.\n\n* When a menu, picker, or modal is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n* **UIKit**\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* \"Button label, chosen option label, button, collapsed\"  (Button that opens dropdown with selected option from dropdown and state)\n* \"Selected, chosen option label, button\" (Selected option in dropdown list)\n* \"Label, button\" (Other options in list that populate dropdown)\n* \"Dismiss context menu, button\"  (Optional Hidden button that closes dropdown)",

As part of a table row/list view, the label, images and other non-interactive content in the row are usually announced together.

          "iosDeveloperNotes": "There is no native expandable or accordion element for iOS.  The notes below are suggestions and accessibility guidance.\n\n### General Notes\n\n* An expandable region is a view that shows items in a two-level list; groups which can individually be expanded to show its children.\n* The expand/collapses indicator (caret) is not focused separately.  As part of a table row/list view, the label, images and other non-interactive content in the row are usually announced together. The caret shows the state, which should be announced as part of the whole row announcement.\n* When the row is activated to expand, the focus stays on that row and does not automatically move to the new content.\n* Name, Role, State must be stated in a single announcement when focus is on the control area (caret icon should not gain focus alone).\n\n### Name\n\n* Programmatic name describes the purpose of the control.\n* If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognition.\n\n**UIKit**\n\n* You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n  * The expandable region title will overwrite the expandable region `accessibilityLabel`.\n* If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the expandable region `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n  * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n* To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n* To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n**SwiftUI**\n\n* If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n\n### Role\n\n* When using non-native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n**UIKit**\n\n* Use `UIButton`\n\n**SwiftUI**\n\n* Use native `DisclosureGroup` view\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Group visible label with button, if applicable, to provide a programmatic name for the button.\n\n**UIKit**\n\n* Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n* Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n  * If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n    * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n**SwiftUI**\n\n* Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n### State\n\n* Append “expanded” or “collapsed” to the accessibilityLabel or accessibilityValue of the button (with logic)\n\n**UIKit**\n\n* For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n* For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n  * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the button to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the button.\n\n**SwiftUI**\n\n* For selected, use `accessibilityAddTraits(.isSelected)`.\n* For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n\n**UIKit**\n\n* If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n  * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n* Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n* `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n**SwiftUI**\n\n* For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n* If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* “Amenities, 2 Hotel amenities selected, collapsed, double tap to activate”  (Label, data, state, role/action)",

Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n  * If frame does not exist due to custom development, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n    * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n* After grouping the paragraph and the in-line link to form a single accessibility element, bind the link action to it.\n  * For the screen reader experience, focus will surround the paragraph container. Double-tapping the paragraph will activate the link.\n  * For the non-screen reader experience, do not bind the link action to the paragraph container. Non-screen readers must tap on the link itself to activate the link.\n\n### State\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n* For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n  * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the link to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the link.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading.\n* When a link is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* Implement focus ring to be around the paragraph container, so that double-tapping the container will activate the in-line link, given that there is only one link inside the container.\n* If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n  * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n* `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* Implement focus ring to be around the paragraph container, so that double-tapping the container will activate the in-line link, given that there is only one link inside the container.\n* For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n* If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* Announcement order can vary\n* \"Label, link\"\n* \"All text in paragraph including url, link\" (link in paragraph)\n* \"Label, dimmed, link\" (disabled)\n\n### Further reading\n\n* [UIAccessibilityTraits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilitytraits)",

The user swipes through the tab group and the content revealed by the tab action should be the first swipe out of the tab group.\n\n### Name\n\n* A programmatic name is assigned to each segment title and tab\n\n* If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * `android:text` XML attribute\n  * Use `contentDescription`, depending on type of view and for elements (icons) without a visible label\n  * `contentDescription` overrides `android:text`\n  * Use `labelFor` attribute to associate the visible label with the control\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * By default, the programmatic name is the visible text label of the segment\n  * Compose uses semantics properties to pass information to accessibility services\n  * Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name to override the default text label\n  * Example specification of contentDescription in compose: `modifier = Modifier.semantics { contentDescription = \"\" }`\n\n### Role\n\n* Since the segmented control items are interactive, it must indicate the interaction of double-tap for segment selecting.\n\n* When not using native controls, roles will need to be manually coded\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * Tabs\n  * Button or Image Button\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * `TabRow`, `Tab`\n  * `Chip`\n\n### Groupings\n\n* N/A\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * Follow native component grouping\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * Follow native component grouping\n\n### State\n\n* Selected state is announced as either \"Selected\" or \"Unselected\" for the control in group that is focused\n\n* The position of the segment out of the entire segment list must be announced\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * Active: `android:enabled=true`\n  * Disabled: `android:enabled=false`. Announcement: \"disabled\"\n  * Selected: Announced as \"selected\"\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * Active: default state is active and enabled. Use `Tab(enabled = true)` to specify explicitly\n  * Disabled: `Tab(enabled = false)` announces as \"disabled\"\n  * Alternatively can use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { disabled() }` to announce as \"disabled\"\n  * Use `Tab(selected = <condition logic>)` to define selected state\n\n### Focus\n\n* Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus\n\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes needs focus management\n\n* **Android Views**\n\n  * `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API\n  * `android:focusable`\n  * `android=clickable`\n  * Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`\n  * `nextFocusDown`\n  * `nextFocusUp`\n  * `nextFocusRight`\n  * `nextFocusLeft`\n  * `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)\n  * To hide controls: `importantForAccessibility=false`\n  * For a `ViewGroup`, set `screenReaderFocusable=true` and each inner object’s attribute to keyboard focus (`focusable=false`)\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n  * `Modifier.focusTarget()` makes the component focusable\n  * `Modifier.focusOrder()` needs to be used in combination with FocusRequesters to define focus order\n  * `Modifier.onFocusEvent()`, `Modifier.onFocusChanged()` can be used to observe the changes to focus state\n  * `FocusRequester` allows to request focus to individual elements with in a group of merged descendant views\n  * Example: To customize the focus events\n    * step 1: define the focus requester prior. `val (first, second) = FocusRequester.createRefs()`\n    * step 2: update the modifier to set the order. `modifier = Modifier.focusOrder(first) { this.down = second }`\n    * focus order accepts following values: up, down, left, right, previous, next, start, end\n    * step 3: use `second.requestFocus()` to gain focus\n\n### Code Example\n\n* **Jetpack Compose**\n\n```java\nvar tabIndex by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }\nval titles = listOf(\"Tab 1\", \"Tab 2\", \"Tab 3\")\nColumn {\n    TabRow(selectedTabIndex = tabIndex) {\n        titles.forEachIndexed { index, title ->\n            Tab(\n                selected = tabIndex == index,\n                onClick = { tabIndex = index },\n                text = { Text(text = title) }\n            )\n        }\n    }\n    Box(modifier = Modifier\n        .fillMaxWidth()\n        .background(MaterialTheme.colorScheme.background)) {\n        Text(\n            modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.Center),\n            text = \"Tab ${tabIndex + 1} selected\",\n            style = MaterialTheme.typography.titleMedium,\n            color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* Options for announcements below depend on device framework and versions. Announcement order can vary.\n* \"Top apps, Selected, Kids, tab, 1 of 4\" (Group label, state, button label, role, index) (Selected)\n* \"Weather, tab, 2 of 4, double tap to activate\" (Button label, role, index, hint) (Not selected)",

The user swipes through the tab group and the content revealed by the tab action should be the first swipe out of the tab group.\n\n### Name\n\n* A programmatic name is assigned to each segment title and tab\n\n* If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n* You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`\n  * The segment's title will overwrite the segment’s `accessibilityLabel`\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n  * By default, the programmatic name is the visible text label of the segment/tab\n  * If necessary, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n  * Use `.accessibilityLabel(label for group)` to announce the group label for the tabs when the first tab is in focus\n  * If a segment has decorative icon(s), hide the icon(s) from VoiceOver by using view modifier `accessibilityHidden(true)`\n\n### Role\n\n* Since picker items are interactive, it must be indicated to the user that they are interactive such as indicating that it is a button or it can be double-tapped to be selected.\n\n* \"Tab\" or \"Button\" usually indicate the role\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Use `UISegmentedControl`\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Use native `Picker` view\n  * Use `SegmentedPickerStyle`\n\n### Groupings\n\n* N/A\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Follow native grouping and order\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * Follow native grouping and order\n\n### State\n\n* A state of the individual segments themselves are announced, which is either \"Selected\" or \"Unselected\"\n\n* The position of the segment out of the entire set (index) must be announced.\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * Segments should be announced whether they are selected/unselected. Often, the button announcement and the absence of \"unselected\" is assumed to be unselected\n  * For disabled menu items: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n    * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the menu item to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the segmented control.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * By default, the \"selected\" state is announced and the position of the segment out of the set.\n  * For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality\n\n* Focus should be confined within the segmented control\n\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus\n\n* **UIKit**\n\n  * If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n    * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n  * To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n  * To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n  * `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n* **SwiftUI**\n\n  * For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n    * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n  * If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* Options for announcements below depend on framework and versions. Announcement order can vary. Index in label is recommended.\n* \"Favorite apps\" (Group label)\n* \"Favorite apps, Selected, Weather, button, one of three\" (Group label, state, button label, role, index) (Selected, on first tab only)\n* \"Photos, button, 2 of 3\" (Button label, role, index) (not selected)\n* \"Clock, dimmed, button, 3 of 3\" (Button label, disabled state, role, index)",

          "developerNotes": "1. **Types of images**\n\n   There are many types of images. The type of image can be determined by the context of the page being tested. These different types of images have different testing steps.\n\n   * **Informative Images:** These are visuals like pictures, photos, and illustrations that convey important information or concepts. To make them accessible, we need to include a brief description in text form that captures the key content of the image.\n\n   * **Decorative Images:** Sometimes, images are used purely for aesthetic purposes and don't convey meaningful information. In such cases, it's best to provide an empty text alternative (alt=\"\") to indicate that the image serves a decorative role and doesn't require a description.\n\n   * **Functional Images:** Images that serve as links or buttons should have text alternatives that describe their function rather than just their appearance. For example, if you have an image of a printer icon that initiates a printing action, the alt text should convey this functionality, like \"Print.\"\n\n   * **Images of Text:** Images of text should be avoided whenever possible. In fact, some images of text can violate [WCAG 1.4.5 Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/images-of-text.html). However, if you must use images with text, ensure that the alt text contains the exact same words as the text within the image to maintain consistency.\n\n   * **Complex Images such as Graphs and Diagrams:** When using images to present complex data or detailed information, it's crucial to provide a comprehensive text description that conveys all the data and details found in the image. This allows individuals who cannot see the image to still access and understand its content.\n\n2. **How to test**\n\n   ### Automated Testing\n\n   Automated scanning tools, such as [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/), [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/), or [Deque's Axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/blog/axe-devtools-extension-update-new-color-contrast-analyzer/) are a great starting point for image testing. All of these tools can run page scans that quickly generate reports identifying some image issues. Scans are:\n\n   * <strong>Good</strong> at identifying simple issues like missing <code>alt</code> attributes on images or empty alt attributes on functional images.\n   * <strong>Bad</strong> at identifying issues related to alternative text quality or whether or not an image should be marked as decorative and hidden from screen readers.\n\n   ### Manual testing\n\n   Automated scanning must be complemented with a manual review of the page. Manual image testing can test for alt text quality, ensuring that decorative images are hidden from assistive technology, all text found in images of text are present in alt text, and that functional images have the appropriate alt text.\n\n   #### <strong>Getting started</strong>\n\n   * Open Chrome DevTools in your browser window <span class=\"keyboard-key\">F12</span>\n   * Right-click and select \"Inspect\" on the image in the page you want to test.\n\n3. **Informative Images**\n\n   * Check that the image owns an <code>alt</code> attribute.\n   * Ensure that the <code>alt</code> attribute is present is not empty.\n   * Ensure that the alt attribute is present is not empty, such as <code>alt</code> or <code>alt=\"\"</code>\n   * The <code>alt</code> attribute value / description of the image should be accurate and succinct. The image alternative should not consist of information that duplicates nearby text content.\n\n   <img\n   src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-images-meaningful-1.png\"\n   alt=\"Inspecting an image in DevTools to check alt text, meaningful image\"/>\n\n   ### IMG\n\n   ```html\n   <img alt=\"A rear view of the iPhone 15 Pro in silver, along with a front view of the iPhone 15 Pro Max in silver.\" src=\"../iphone.png\" ... >\n   ```\n\n   ### SVG\n\n   Some images are implemented using inline <code>SVG</code>. Text alernatives for these images can be defined by use of <code>role=\"img\"</code> and <code>aria-label=\"I am the alt text\"</code>. The <code>alt</code> attribute should not be on an element whose <code>role</code> is <code>role=\"img\"</code> this is instead handled by <code>aria-label</code>.\n\n   ```html\n   <svg role=\"img\" aria-label=\"I am the alt text\">...</svg>\n   ```\n\n4. **Decorative Images**\n\n   * Ensure that the <code>alt</code> attribute is present and owns an empty or null value. <code>alt=\"\"</code>.\n   * <strong>Note:</strong> <code>aria-hidden=\"true\"</code> is not needed if an image has an empty or null alt attribute value <code>alt=\"\"</code>.\n\n    <img src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-images-decorative-1.png\" alt=\"Inspecting an image in DevTools to check alt text, decorative image\">\n\n   ```html\n   <img alt=\"\" src=\"../some-image.png\" ...>\n   ```\n\n5. **Functional Images**\n\n   * Ensure the <code>alt</code> attribute is present and owns a value that includes <strong>all</strong> of the text found in the image.\n   * Functional images are typically links or buttons so the alt text should define the purpose of the link instead of describing the image.\n\n    <img src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-images-functional.png\" alt=\"Inspecting an image in DevTools to check alt text, functional image\">\n\n   * **Note:** Functional images can have empty or null alt attribute values <code>alt=\"\"</code> if the text alternative is conveyed in the parent control's label. For example, <code>aria-label=\"Download on the Apple App Store\"</code>.\n\n   ```html\n   <button aria-label=\"Download on the Apple App Store\">\n       <img src=\"apple.png\" alt=\"\">\n   </button>\n   ```\n\n6. **Images of Text**\n\n   * Sometimes text can't be easily created with HTML and CSS and an image must contain text. In this case, ensure the <code>alt</code> attribute is present and owns a value that includes <strong>all</strong> of the text found in the image.\n   * Typically, the text is the most important part of the image. There is no need for the image itself to be described unless it adds value to the content of the page.\n   * Consider logging a defect for [WCAG 1.4.5 Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/images-of-text.html) if it seems like there might be a viable workaround to add real text to the page vs. an image of text.\n\n    <img src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-test-images-text.png\" alt=\"Inspecting an image in DevTools to check alt text, image of text example\">\n\n   ```html\n   <img src=\"apple-iphone-15-pro.png\" alt=\"Titanium Apple iPhone 15 Pro\">\n   ```\n\n7. **Complex Images**\n\n   * Data visualizations, charts, and graphs can be very difficult to author alternative text for. Some features like charts and graphs may not be accessible themselves but there can be text alternatives nearby that can act as an accessible alternative.\n   * For complex images that are <code>img</code> elements, ensure that the image has an <code>alt</code> attribute and that its value communicates the general purpose of the image. This alt text does not need to contain all of the visual information as that may be too long for an appropriate alt text value. If the alt text does not describe all content in the image ensure there is content nearby, or linked to, that does contain all of the visual information in text form.\n   * For charts and graphs, these features are typically not 100% accessible. Ensure there is content nearby, or linked to, that does contain all of the visual information in text form. For example, an accessible Excel download or HTML Table presenting the key visual information from the content found in the chart.\n   * <strong>Note:</strong> It is important that all text alternatives to complex images must be in an accessible format to qualify as an accessible alternative.\n\n    <img src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-test-images-complex-data.png\" alt=\"Complex chart with nearby HTML table for text alternative\">\n\n   ```html\n   <img src=\"/assets/images/examples/how-to-test-images-complex-data.png\" alt=\"Complex chart with nearby HTML table for text alternative\">\n\n   <table>\n       <caption>NASDAQ: TMUS</caption>\n       <tr>\n       <th>Date</th>\n       <th>Price</th>\n       <!-- ... -->\n       </tr>\n       <tr>\n       <td>January 10</td>\n       <td>122.20</td>\n       <!-- ... -->\n       </tr>\n   </table>\n   ```\n\n8. **What to test for**\n\n    <div class=\"how-to-test-checklist-item\">\n    <h3>✓ Ensure meaningful images have alt text</h3>\n    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The passing example has alt text that matches the text found in the image.

For example, buttons and links.\n         </td>\n       </tr>\n       <tr>\n         <th scope=\"row\">\n           <span >Shift + Tab</span>\n         </th>\n         <td>\n           Moves in reverse through the interface focusing on elements that are focusable.\n         </td>\n       </tr>\n       <tr>\n         <th scope=\"row\">\n           <span >Enter</span>\n         </th>\n         <td>\n           Activates links and buttons\n         </td>\n       </tr>\n       <tr>\n         <th scope=\"row\">\n           <span >Spacebar</span>\n         </th>\n         <td>\n           Activates buttons and interacts with form elements\n         </td>\n       </tr>\n       <tr>\n         <th scope=\"row\">\n           <span >Escape</span>\n         </th>\n         <td>\n           Should close or dismiss widgets like dialogs\n         </td>\n       </tr>  \n     </tbody>\n   </table>\n\n3. **What to test for**\n\n   * <div >\n       <h3>✓ Ensure all mouse functionality is present for keyboard</h3>\n       <p>Identify functionality within the experience that can be operated with a mouse or pointing device. Ensure this content can be accessed with they keyboard alone.</p>\n     </div>\n   * <div >\n       <h3>✓ Ensure there is a highly visible visual indication of keyboard focus</h3>\n       <p>Keyboard users need to understand where they are in the interface at all times. The visual indication of keyboard focus (focus ring) should be highly visible and have a color contrast ratio of 3:1 against the background. Verify that overlap items (e.g. cookie banners, sticky footers, sticky headers, and non-modal dialogs) do not obscure the visual indicator. </p>\n     </div>\n   * <div >\n       <h3>✓ Ensure that there are no keyboard traps</h3>\n       <p>Ensure that while navigating the experience, you do not encounter situations where you are not able to move forward or backward with the keyboard alone.</p>\n     </div>\n   * <div >\n       <h3>✓ Verify that the focus order is logical</h3>\n       <p>In an English-based experience, keyboard focus should move top-to-bottom and left-to-right in a logical order. Ensure focus is not jumping around the experience in a way that makes it hard to understand the content.</p>\n     </div>\n   * <div >\n       <h3>✓ On focus does not create a change of context</h3>\n       <p>Ensure that when an interactive element receives keyboard focus that a change of context is not initiated without warning of such behavoir. An example of change of context is a page load or web form submission.</p>\n     </div>\n   * <div >\n       <h3>✓ Test for skip links</h3>\n       <p>Where there are large chunks of repeated content, ensure that there are skip links present for keboard users. For example, on a site with a large site navigation system, the first focusable element in the page should be a link that allows users to jump to the main content of the site.</p>\n     </div>\n\n### Video Example\n\n<video controls>\n  <source src=\"media/video/how-to-test/how-to-keyboard.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n\n<hr>\n\n### Related WCAG\n\n* 1.4.11: Non-text Contrast\n* 2.1.1 Keyboard\n* 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap\n* 2.4.3 Focus Order\n* 2.4.7 Focus Visible\n* 3.2.1 On Focus\n\n### Resources\n\n[WebAIM Keyboard Accessibility](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/)"
