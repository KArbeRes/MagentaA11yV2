In a case like this, `aria-label` can be used to name each control’s purpose.\n\n```html\n<button aria-label=\"Edit payment date\">\n  Edit\n</div>\n<button aria-label=\"Edit payment amount\">\n  Edit\n</div>\n```\n\n## Developer notes\n\n### Name\n\n* Inner text should describe the purpose of the button.\n* `aria-label=\"Button purpose\"` can also be used (as a last resort)\n\n### Role\n\n* Native button identifies as button by default\n* Use `role=\"button\"` for custom elements\n\n### Group\n\n* Use `aria-haspopup=\"true\"` for menu, listbox or modal\n* `aria-controls=\"popupId\"` is not well supported\n\n### State\n\n* Toggle buttons `aria-pressed=\"true/false\"`\n* Menus or expanders use `aria-expanded=\"true/false\"`\n* Use the `disabled` state for completely inactive buttons that shouldn’t be focusable\n* Use `aria-disabled=\"true/false\"` state for inactive custom elements\n\n### Focus\n\n* Focus must be visible\n* Custom elements (like `<div>`) need `tabindex=\"0\"` to be focusable"

Note that `alt` and `alt=\"\"` (no space) are equivalent in HTML.\n  * When the `alt` attribute is empty, the screen reader ignores it (and will not read anything).\n  * When the `alt` attribute is missing, the screen reader will read the `src` name or filename of the image which is a very poor user experience.\n\n<example class=\"example example--contains-icon\">\n  <h3 class=\"h-charlie decorated\">\n    <img src=\"media/images/icons/icon-info.svg\" alt=\"\"> \n    Note: Your plan might be changing soon.\n  </h3>\n  <a href=\"tel:8888888888\" className=\"decorated\">\n    <img src=\"media/images/icons/icon-phone.svg\" class=\"icon\" alt=\"\">\n      Call us: 888-888-8888\n  </a>\n</example>\n\n```html\n<h3 class=\"h-charlie decorated\">\n  <img\n    src=\"media/images/icons/icon-info.svg\"\n    class=\"icon\"\n    alt=\"\" />\n  Note: Your plan might be changing soon.\n</h3>\n<a \n  href=\"tel:8888888888\"\n  class=\"decorated\">\n  <img \n    src=\"media/images/icons/icon-phone.svg\"\n    class=\"icon\"\n    alt=\"\" />\n    Call us: 888-888-8888\n</a>\n```\n\n## Using inline SVG\n\n### Inline SVG that is decorative\n\nInline SVGs require some special code to be hidden properly from screen readers:\n\n* `aria-hidden=\"true\"`\n\nIf you are using a `<use />` element, add `aria-hidden=\"true\"`.\n\n```html\n<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\">\n  <use href=\"#svg-id\" aria-hidden=\"true\" />\n  <!-- if not using <use> then the child elements \n       of the inline SVG would go here -->\n</svg>\n```\n\n## Further reading\n\n* This page owes a lot to this exhaustive blog post: [Contextually Marking up accessible images and SVGs by Scott O'Hara](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/05/22/contextual-images-svgs-and-a11y.html)\n* [W3C Image decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/)"

Avoid using tables for layout purposes.\n\n### Use Semantic HTML\n\nThis semantic HTML contains all accessibility features by default.\\\nOptional: The table is wrapped in a `<figure>` to indicate author and source.\n\n```html\n<table id=\"nato-table\">\n  <caption class=\"h-charlie\">\n    Nato phonetic Alphabet\n  </caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">Letter</th>\n      <th scope=\"col\">A</th>\n      <th scope=\"col\">B</th>\n      <th scope=\"col\">C</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">NATO</th>\n      <td>Alpha</td>\n      <td>Bravo</td>\n      <td>Charlie</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n```\n\n<table class=\"text-center\">\n  <caption>\n    Nato phonetic Alphabet\n  </caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">Letter</th>\n      <th scope=\"col\">A</th>\n      <th scope=\"col\">B</th>\n      <th scope=\"col\">C</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">NATO</th>\n      <td>Alpha</td>\n      <td>Bravo</td>\n      <td>Charlie</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<table class=\"text-center\">\n<caption>\n    Screen reader and browser pairings\n  </caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Platform</th>\n      <th>Screenreader</th>\n      <th>Browser</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <img src=\"media/images/icons/logo-apple.svg\" alt=\"Apple\"> \n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <img src=\"media/images/icons/logo-apple.svg\" alt=\"VoiceOver\"> \n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <img src=\"media/images/icons/logo-safari.svg\" alt=\"Safari\"> \n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <img src=\"media/images/icons/logo-android.svg\" alt=\"Android\"> \n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <img src=\"media/images/icons/logo-talkback.svg\" alt=\"Talkback\"> \n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <img src=\"media/images/icons/logo-chrome.svg\" alt=\"Chrome\">\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <img src=\"media/images/icons/logo-windows.svg\" alt=\"Windows\"> \n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <img src=\"media/images/icons/logo-jaws.svg\" alt=\"JAWS\">\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <img src=\"media/images/icons/logo-chrome.svg\" alt=\"Chrome\"> \n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <img src=\"media/images/icons/logo-windows.svg\" alt=\"Windows\">\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <img src=\"media/images/icons/logo-nvda.svg\" alt=\"NVDA\">\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <img src=\"media/images/icons/logo-chrome.svg\" alt=\"Chrome\"> \n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <img src=\"media/images/icons/logo-apple.svg\" alt=\"Apple\">\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <img src=\"media/images/icons/logo-apple.svg\" alt=\"VoiceOver\"> \n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <img src=\"media/images/icons/logo-safari.svg\" alt=\"Safari\"> \n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n### When You Can’t Use Semantic HTML\n\nIf tabular data must be displayed without a `<table>` element, additional attributes are required.\n\n```html\n<div role=\"table\" aria-describedby=\"table-desc\">\n  <div id=\"table-desc\">Nato phonetic alphabet</div>\n  <div role=\"rowgroup\">\n    <div role=\"row\">\n      <span role=\"columnheader\">Letter</span>\n      <span role=\"columnheader\">NATO</span>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div role=\"rowgroup\">\n    <div role=\"row\">\n      <span role=\"cell\">A</span>\n      <span role=\"cell\">Alpha</span>\n    </div>\n    <div role=\"row\">\n      <span role=\"cell\">B</span>\n      <span role=\"cell\">Bravo</span>\n    </div>\n    <div role=\"row\">\n      <span role=\"cell\">C</span>\n      <span role=\"cell\">Charlie</span>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Developer Notes\n\n### Name\n\n* The table can be named by a heading above or a `<caption>`.\n\n### Role\n\n* Semantic `<table>` structures identify headers appropriately and honor screenreader keyboard shortcuts.\n\n### Group\n\n* Wrapping a table in a `<figure>` element can build a relationship to `<figcaption>` and `<cite>`.\n\n### State\n\n* Sortable tables can use `aria-sort` to indicate state."

          "developerNotes": "## Building accessible forms\n\n### Do not auto focus inputs\n\n* Automatically moving focus to an input field is very confusing for people using assistive technology.\n\n### Group inputs\n\nUse `fieldset` and `legend` to group related fields, such as:\n\n* Sign in\n* Shipping address\n* Payment information\n\n### Error handling\n\n* Individual inputs must have [programmatically described errors](https://www.magentaa11y.com/checklist-web/hint-help-error/) read by the screen reader on focus.\n* For long forms, list all errors in an [alert](https://www.magentaa11y.com/checklist-web/alert/) with links back to each invalid input on submission attempts.\n\n## UX guidance\n\n### Affordance: field width indicates the expected input\n\nForm field width should afford the user space to enter the characters that will be required. Do not arbitrarily limit the width of names, usernames, passwords or emails.\n\nPractical Examples\n\n* Middle initial should be wide enough to accommodate 1 character\n* State abbreviations should be wide enough to accommodate 2 characters\n* Zip code must be wide enough to accommodate 5 characters\n* Pin numbers reflect the number of digits expected\n\n### Why we stack inputs\n\nDo not put forms in multiple columns.\n\n* People are accustomed to scrolling vertically. There is no advantage to making the page take up less vertical space.\n* People with low vision may be using a zoom tool, enlarging the view of their screen and thus only seeing a portion of the form. If there is a column on the right side, it will be difficult to discover the fields.\n* Do not place submit buttons in a sidebar unless there is also a submit button at the bottom of the form\n\n### Why we use autocomplete\n\n* Utilizing [autocomplete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/autocomplete) allows users automated assistance in filling out form field values.\n* Autocomplete is helpful for all customers leading to a speedier conversion\n* For those with motor disabilities, it eliminates the need to laboriously enter information\n\n## Code examples\n\n### Use semantic HTML\n\n```html\n<form aria-label=\"Sign in\">\n  <fieldset>\n    <legend>Sign in</legend>\n    <label for=\"username\">Username</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\">\n    <button type=\"submit\">Sign in</button>\n  </fieldset>\n</form>\n```\n\n<example>\n    <form aria-label=\"Sign in\">\n      <fieldset>\n        <legend>Sign in</legend>\n        <label for=\"username\">Username</label>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\">\n        <button class=\"Magentaa11y-button Magentaa11y-button--primary\" type=\"submit\">Sign in</button>\n      </fieldset>\n    </form>\n</example>\n\n### Credit card information\n\nUse `fieldset` and `legend` to group related fields, such as:\n\n* This form uses minimal unobtrusive masking to make the credit card number more readable. (When done poorly, masking can can cause the field to be read repeatedly as the mask refreshes)\n* Autofill attributes to help customers complete fields with less effort.\n* Using `inputmode=\"numeric\"` brings up the numeric keyboard on mobile devices making entry easier.\n\n```html\n<form aria-label=\"Payment information\">\n  <fieldset>\n    <legend>\n      Enter your

In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' `contentDescription` or names, one after the other, in a single announcement.\n\n#### Jetpack Compose\n\n* `Modifier.semantics(mergeDescendants = true) {}` is equivalent to `importantForAccessibility` when compared to android views\n* `FocusRequester.createRefs()` helps to request focus to inner elements with in the group\n\n***\n\n### State\n\n#### Android Views\n\n* Active: `android:enabled=true`\n* Disabled: `android:enabled=false`. Announcement: disabled\n\n#### Jetpack Compose\n\n* Active: default state is active and enabled. Use `Button(enabled = true)` to specify explicitly\n* Disabled:  `Button(enabled = false)` announces as disabled\n* Alternatively can use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { disabled() }` to announce as disabled\n* Use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { stateDescription = \"\" }` to have a customized state announcement\n\n***\n\n### Focus\n\n* Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes needs focus management\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place (back button, screen title, first text field, first heading), except when changing between navigation tabs\n* When a menu, picker or modal is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n#### Android Views\n\n* `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API\n* `android:focusable`\n* `android=clickable`\n* Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`\n* `nextFocusDown`\n* `nextFocusUp`\n* `nextFocusRight`\n* `nextFocusLeft`\n* `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)\n* To hide controls: `importantForAccessibility=false`\n* For a `ViewGroup`, set `screenReaderFocusable=true` and each inner object’s attribute to keyboard focus (`focusable=false`)\n\n#### Jetpack Compose\n\n* `Modifier.focusTarget()` makes the component focusable\n* `Modifier.focusOrder()` needs to be used in combination with FocusRequesters to define focus order\n* `Modifier.onFocusEvent()`, `Modifier.onFocusChanged()` can be used to observe the changes to focus state\n* `FocusRequester` allows to request focus to individual elements with in a group of merged descendant views\n* Example: To customize the focus events\n  * step 1: define the focus requester prior. `val (first, second) = FocusRequester.createRefs()`\n  * step 2: update the modifier to set the order. `modifier = Modifier.focusOrder(first) { this.down = second }`\n  * focus order accepts following values: up, down, left, right, previous, next, start, end\n  * step 3: use `second.requestFocus()` to gain focus\n\n***\n\n### Custom Accessibility Action\n\n* When UI elements are customized and coded to look like a specific component say button, to ensure that name, role, state and action are all intact might need to update accessibility service and semantics.\n* Disclaimer: This customization would not be needed unless it is required to modify/add gestures or actions.\n* The Button class by default supplies all the necessary semantics to make it fully accessible.\n\n#### Android Views\n\n* step 1: Create an accessibility service\n* step 2: Add the `FLAG_REQUEST_ACCESSIBILITY_BUTTON` flag in an AccessibilityServiceInfo object's `android:accessibilityFlags` attribute\n* step 3: To have a custom service register for the button's custom action callbacks, use `registerAccessibilityButtonCallback()`\n\n#### Jetpack Compose\n\n* List of custom accessibility actions can be defined relatively easily in compose compared to Views using customActions.\n* Example: `modifier = Modifier.semantics { customActions = listOf(CustomAccessibilityAction(label = \"\", action = { true }))}`\n\n***\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* \"button\" in announcements below comes from the accessibility services most of the time when a native component is used, not from \"button\" in the label\n  * **Note:** When the user has hints turned on in settings, \"double tap to activate\" will announce at the end of most interactive controls.  Testing should be done with hints turned on to ensure the user understands a control is interactive by hearing either \"button\" or \"double tap to activate\" or both.  Announcements on Android devices vary slightly due to manufacturer.\n* \"Label, button, double tap to activate\"\n* \"Label, (other content in cell), button, double tap to activate\" (grouping)\n* \"Label, button, selected, double tap to activate\" (selected state)\n* \"Label, disabled\" (disabled state)",

Assigning “Button” as the role will handle this announcement.\n  * **Incorrect announcement**: “Submit button, Button”\n  * **Correct announcement**: “Submit, Button”\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.\n  * The button’s title will overwrite the button’s `accessibilityLabel`.\n* If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the button’s `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.\n  * To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector\n* To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label’s `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`\n* To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `AccessibilityEnabled` in the Identity Inspector.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.\n* If button has icon(s), hide the icon(s) from VoiceOver by using view modifier `accessibilityHidden(true)`.\n\n***\n\n### Role\n\n* When using non-native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* Use `UIButton`\n* If necessary, set `accessibilityTraits` to `.button`.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* Use native `Button` view\n* If necessary, use view modifier `accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)` to assign the role as `Button`.\n* If applicable, use view modifier `accessibilityRemoveTraits(:)` to remove unwanted traits.\n\n***\n\n### Groupings\n\nGroup visible label with button, if applicable, to provide a programmatic name for the button and not duplicate the name announcement\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n* Set `isAccessibilityElement` to true for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n* If frame does not exist due to custom button, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n  * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n* Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n* Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildre`n to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* Use view `modifier accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n\n***\n\n### State\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n* For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is “Dimmed”.\n  * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the button to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the button.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* For selected, use `accessibilityAddTraits(.isSelected)`.\n* For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n***\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n* Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading, except when changing between navigation tabs\n* When a menu, picker, or modal is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n#### UIKit\n\n* If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n  * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n* Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n* `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n#### SwiftUI\n\n* For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n* If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n***\n\n### Announcement examples\n\nOptions for announcements below depend on implementation. Announcement order can vary.\n\n* \"Label, button\"\n* \"Label, (other content in cell), button\" (grouping)\n* \"Label, button, selected\" (selected state)\n* \"Label, dimmed, button\" (disabled state)\n\n***",

Alt text on the image that describes its purpose.\n  2. Name describes the purpose of the control and matches any visible text in image\n  3. Programmatic name of each interactive component in audio challenge is announced\n\n#### **Android Views**\n\n* `android:text` XML attribute\n* Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name, depending on type of view and for elements (icons) without a visible label\n* `contentDescription` overrides `android:text`\n* Use `labelFor` attribute to associate any visible label with the control\n\n#### **Jetpack Compose**\n\n* Compose uses semantics properties to pass information to accessibility services.\n* The built-in Button composable will fill the semantics properties with information inferred from the composable by default.\n* Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name to override the default visible label of the button text.\n* Example specification of contentDescription in compose: `modifier = Modifier.semantics { contentDescription = \"\" }`\n\n### Role\n\n* Experiences (refer to number above):\n  1. Identifies as an image\n  2. Identifies as an image button\n  3. Each interactive component in audio challenge identifies as a button or edit box\n\n#### **Android Views**\n\n* When not using native controls (ie, custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n* Standard button or ImageButton\n\n#### **Jetpack Compose**\n\n* Standard `Button` composable\n\n### Groupings\n\n#### **Android Views**\n\n* `ViewGroup`\n* Set the container object's `android:screenReaderFocusable` attribute to true, and each inner object's `android:focusable` attribute to false. In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' `contentDescription` or names, one after the other, in a single announcement.\n\n#### **Jetpack Compose**\n\n* `Modifier.semantics(mergeDescendants = true) {}` is equivalent to `importantForAccessibility` when compared to android views\n* `FocusRequester.createRefs()` helps to request focus to inner elements with in the group\n\n### State\n\n* Experiences (refer to number above):\n  1. If grouped in table row, it's possible for the whole row to have a disabled state, or the captcha button disabled separately\n  2. Image button can have a disabled state (disabled)\n  3.

Use `Button(enabled = true)` to specify explicitly\n* Disabled: `Button(enabled = false)` announces as disabled\n* Alternatively can use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { disabled() }` to announce as disabled\n* Use `modifier = Modifier.semantics { stateDescription = \"\" }` to have a customized state announcement\n\n### Focus\n\n* Experiences (refer to number above):\n  1. Focus is on the whole table row. There should be no focus on any single element, if the whole table row is grouped together, as long as there is only one interactive element per row.\n  2. The image button receives focus by swipe or touch\n  3. Each element in audio challenge receives focus by swipe or touch.

Screen readers can only access the first link in the paragraph.\n* The correct execution of native app controls informs assistive technologies, such as voice control, screen readers, and switch access, that the element is interactive.\n\n### Name\n\n* Interactive text that describes the destination or purpose of the link\n* Programmatic name matches the visible text label\n  * **Note:** If adding context to a generic link, ensure the visible text for the link is the first part of the label and it matches the visible text.

Announcement order can vary. \"Double tap to activate\" hint announcement varies with implementation.\n\n* \"Label, link\"\n* \"Label, link, double tap to activate\"\n* \"Label, double tap to activate, links available, tap with three fingers to view\" (TalkBack menu appears)\n* \"All text in paragraph including link name, links available, tap with three fingers to view\" (link in paragraph)\n* \"Text in sentence, link name, link, remainder of sentence, double tap to activate, links available, tap with three fingers to view\" (link in sentence with separate link focus)\n* \"Label, disabled\" (disabled)",
          "iosDeveloperNotes": "### **Developer Notes**\n\n* Actionable link that navigates the user outside of the app to a web page (ex: opens a web browser).\n* When accessing an in-line link that is inside a paragraph with a screen reader, the focus is usually around the paragraph container.\n* To activate a link, screen reader users can double tap both inline links and links outside of paragraphs.\n* There should only be a single inline link inside of a paragraph. Screen readers can only access the first link in the paragraph.\n* The correct execution of native app controls informs assistive technologies, such as voice control, screen readers, and switch access, that the element is interactive.\n\n### Name\n\n* Interactive text that describes the destination or purpose of the link\n* Programmatic name matches the visible text label\n  * **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognization.\n  * **Note:** If adding context to a generic link, ensure the visible text for the link is the first part of the label and it matches the visible text. For example, a link the has a visual label of \"Learn more\" that is not part of a paragraph may need a label with greater context in the code so it is announced by a screen reader as \"Learn more about accessible controls\".\n  * **Note:** If adding context to a generic link, ensure the visible text for the link is the first part of the label and it matches the visible text. For example, a link the has a visual label of \"Learn more\" that is not part of a paragraph may need a label with greater context in the code so it is announced by a screen reader as \"Learn more about accessible controls\".\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* The link's visible text will overwrite the link's `accessibilityLabel`.\n* If necessary, change the element's `accessibilityLabel` property.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* The link's visible text will overwrite the link's `accessibilityLabel`.\n* If necessary, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)` to change the `accessibilityLabel`.\n\n### Role\n\n* When using non-native app controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* Since UIKit does not have a native link, develop using `UIButton`\n  * If using a `UIButton` is not suitable for your use case, you may try the following strategies:\n    * Use a `UITextView` with a `NSAttributedString` with a `.link` attribute, OR\n    * Use a `UILabel` or related view and apply a `UITapGestureRecognizer`\n    * **Note:** The more complex your custom control is, the more complex the accessibility implementation can be\n* Set `accessibilityTraits` to `.link`\n* Stylize the text to appear as a link\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* Use native `Link` view\n* If necessary, use view modifier `accessibilityAddTraits(.isLink)` to assign the role as Link.\n* If applicable, use view modifier `accessibilityRemoveTraits(:)` to remove unwanted traits.\n\n### Groupings\n\n* Link text can be grouped with paragraph text to make a larger touch target, provided there is only one interactive link in view.\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* Ensure that the child elements, such as the in-line link, of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.\n* Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.\n  * If frame does not exist due to custom development, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.\n    * You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.\n  * Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.\n* After grouping the paragraph and the in-line link to form a single accessibility element, bind the link action to it.\n  * For the screen reader experience, focus will surround the paragraph container. Double-tapping the paragraph will activate the link.\n  * For the non-screen reader experience, do not bind the link action to the paragraph container. Non-screen readers must tap on the link itself to activate the link.\n\n### State\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.\n* For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is \"Dimmed\".\n  * If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the link to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the link.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.\n\n### Focus\n\n* Use the device's default focus functionality.\n* External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.\n* Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading.\n* When a link is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.\n\n#### **UIKit**\n\n* Implement focus ring to be around the paragraph container, so that double-tapping the container will activate the in-line link, given that there is only one link inside the container.\n* If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`\n  * **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.\n* To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.\n* To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.\n* `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.\n\n#### **SwiftUI**\n\n* Implement focus ring to be around the paragraph container, so that double-tapping the container will activate the in-line link, given that there is only one link inside the container.\n* For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.\n  * Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.\n* If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.\n\n### Announcement examples\n\n* Announcement order can vary\n* \"Label, link\"\n* \"All text in paragraph including url, link\" (link in paragraph)\n* \"Label, dimmed, link\" (disabled)\n\n### Further reading\n\n* [UIAccessibilityTraits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilitytraits)",

          "developerNotes": "1. **Types of images**\n\n   There are many types of images. The type of image can be determined by the context of the page being tested. These different types of images have different testing steps.\n\n   * **Informative Images:** These are visuals like pictures, photos, and illustrations that convey important information or concepts. To make them accessible, we need to include a brief description in text form that captures the key content of the image.\n\n   * **Decorative Images:** Sometimes, images are used purely for aesthetic purposes and don't convey meaningful information. In such cases, it's best to provide an empty text alternative (alt=\"\") to indicate that the image serves a decorative role and doesn't require a description.\n\n   * **Functional Images:** Images that serve as links or buttons should have text alternatives that describe their function rather than just their appearance. For example, if you have an image of a printer icon that initiates a printing action, the alt text should convey this functionality, like \"Print.\"\n\n   * **Images of Text:** Images of text should be avoided whenever possible. In fact, some images of text can violate [WCAG 1.4.5 Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/images-of-text.html). However, if you must use images with text, ensure that the alt text contains the exact same words as the text within the image to maintain consistency.\n\n   * **Complex Images such as Graphs and Diagrams:** When using images to present complex data or detailed information, it's crucial to provide a comprehensive text description that conveys all the data and details found in the image. This allows individuals who cannot see the image to still access and understand its content.\n\n2. **How to test**\n\n   ### Automated Testing\n\n   Automated scanning tools, such as [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/), [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/), or [Deque's Axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/blog/axe-devtools-extension-update-new-color-contrast-analyzer/) are a great starting point for image testing. All of these tools can run page scans that quickly generate reports identifying some image issues. Scans are:\n\n   * <strong>Good</strong> at identifying simple issues like missing <code>alt</code> attributes on images or empty alt attributes on functional images.\n   * <strong>Bad</strong> at identifying issues related to alternative text quality or whether or not an image should be marked as decorative and hidden from screen readers.\n\n   ### Manual testing\n\n   Automated scanning must be complemented with a manual review of the page. Manual image testing can test for alt text quality, ensuring that decorative images are hidden from assistive technology, all text found in images of text are present in alt text, and that functional images have the appropriate alt text.\n\n   #### <strong>Getting started</strong>\n\n   * Open Chrome DevTools in your browser window <span class=\"keyboard-key\">F12</span>\n   * Right-click and select \"Inspect\" on the image in the page you want to test.\n\n3. **Informative Images**\n\n   * Check that the image owns an <code>alt</code> attribute.\n   * Ensure that the <code>alt</code> attribute is present is not empty.\n   * Ensure that the alt attribute is present is not empty, such as <code>alt</code> or <code>alt=\"\"</code>\n   * The <code>alt</code> attribute value / description of the image should be accurate and succinct. The image alternative should not consist of information that duplicates nearby text content.\n\n   <img\n   src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-images-meaningful-1.png\"\n   alt=\"Inspecting an image in DevTools to check alt text, meaningful image\"/>\n\n   ### IMG\n\n   ```html\n   <img alt=\"A rear view of the iPhone 15 Pro in silver, along with a front view of the iPhone 15 Pro Max in silver.\" src=\"../iphone.png\" ... >\n   ```\n\n   ### SVG\n\n   Some images are implemented using inline <code>SVG</code>. Text alernatives for these images can be defined by use of <code>role=\"img\"</code> and <code>aria-label=\"I am the alt text\"</code>. The <code>alt</code> attribute should not be on an element whose <code>role</code> is <code>role=\"img\"</code> this is instead handled by <code>aria-label</code>.\n\n   ```html\n   <svg role=\"img\" aria-label=\"I am the alt text\">...</svg>\n   ```\n\n4. **Decorative Images**\n\n   * Ensure that the <code>alt</code> attribute is present and owns an empty or null value. <code>alt=\"\"</code>.\n   * <strong>Note:</strong> <code>aria-hidden=\"true\"</code> is not needed if an image has an empty or null alt attribute value <code>alt=\"\"</code>.\n\n    <img src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-images-decorative-1.png\" alt=\"Inspecting an image in DevTools to check alt text, decorative image\">\n\n   ```html\n   <img alt=\"\" src=\"../some-image.png\" ...>\n   ```\n\n5. **Functional Images**\n\n   * Ensure the <code>alt</code> attribute is present and owns a value that includes <strong>all</strong> of the text found in the image.\n   * Functional images are typically links or buttons so the alt text should define the purpose of the link instead of describing the image.\n\n    <img src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-images-functional.png\" alt=\"Inspecting an image in DevTools to check alt text, functional image\">\n\n   * **Note:** Functional images can have empty or null alt attribute values <code>alt=\"\"</code> if the text alternative is conveyed in the parent control's label. For example, <code>aria-label=\"Download on the Apple App Store\"</code>.\n\n   ```html\n   <button aria-label=\"Download on the Apple App Store\">\n       <img src=\"apple.png\" alt=\"\">\n   </button>\n   ```\n\n6. **Images of Text**\n\n   * Sometimes text can't be easily created with HTML and CSS and an image must contain text. In this case, ensure the <code>alt</code> attribute is present and owns a value that includes <strong>all</strong> of the text found in the image.\n   * Typically, the text is the most important part of the image. There is no need for the image itself to be described unless it adds value to the content of the page.\n   * Consider logging a defect for [WCAG 1.4.5 Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/images-of-text.html) if it seems like there might be a viable workaround to add real text to the page vs. an image of text.\n\n    <img src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-test-images-text.png\" alt=\"Inspecting an image in DevTools to check alt text, image of text example\">\n\n   ```html\n   <img src=\"apple-iphone-15-pro.png\" alt=\"Titanium Apple iPhone 15 Pro\">\n   ```\n\n7. **Complex Images**\n\n   * Data visualizations, charts, and graphs can be very difficult to author alternative text for. Some features like charts and graphs may not be accessible themselves but there can be text alternatives nearby that can act as an accessible alternative.\n   * For complex images that are <code>img</code> elements, ensure that the image has an <code>alt</code> attribute and that its value communicates the general purpose of the image. This alt text does not need to contain all of the visual information as that may be too long for an appropriate alt text value. If the alt text does not describe all content in the image ensure there is content nearby, or linked to, that does contain all of the visual information in text form.\n   * For charts and graphs, these features are typically not 100% accessible. Ensure there is content nearby, or linked to, that does contain all of the visual information in text form. For example, an accessible Excel download or HTML Table presenting the key visual information from the content found in the chart.\n   * <strong>Note:</strong> It is important that all text alternatives to complex images must be in an accessible format to qualify as an accessible alternative.\n\n    <img src=\"media/images/how-to-test/how-to-test-images-complex-data.png\" alt=\"Complex chart with nearby HTML table for text alternative\">\n\n   ```html\n   <img src=\"/assets/images/examples/how-to-test-images-complex-data.png\" alt=\"Complex chart with nearby HTML table for text alternative\">\n\n   <table>\n       <caption>NASDAQ: TMUS</caption>\n       <tr>\n       <th>Date</th>\n       <th>Price</th>\n       <!-- ... -->\n       </tr>\n       <tr>\n       <td>January 10</td>\n       <td>122.20</td>\n       <!-- ... -->\n       </tr>\n   </table>\n   ```\n\n8. **What to test for**\n\n    <div class=\"how-to-test-checklist-item\">\n    <h3>✓ Ensure meaningful images have alt text</h3>\n    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The passing example has alt text that matches the text found in the image.

Ensure this content can be accessed with they keyboard alone.</p>\n     </div>\n   * <div >\n       <h3>✓ Ensure there is a highly visible visual indication of keyboard focus</h3>\n       <p>Keyboard users need to understand where they are in the interface at all times. The visual indication of keyboard focus (focus ring) should be highly visible and have a color contrast ratio of 3:1 against the background. Verify that overlap items (e.g. cookie banners, sticky footers, sticky headers, and non-modal dialogs) do not obscure the visual indicator. </p>\n     </div>\n   * <div >\n       <h3>✓ Ensure that there are no keyboard traps</h3>\n       <p>Ensure that while navigating the experience, you do not encounter situations where you are not able to move forward or backward with the keyboard alone.</p>\n     </div>\n   * <div >\n       <h3>✓ Verify that the focus order is logical</h3>\n       <p>In an English-based experience, keyboard focus should move top-to-bottom and left-to-right in a logical order. Ensure focus is not jumping around the experience in a way that makes it hard to understand the content.</p>\n     </div>\n   * <div >\n       <h3>✓ On focus does not create a change of context</h3>\n       <p>Ensure that when an interactive element receives keyboard focus that a change of context is not initiated without warning of such behavoir. An example of change of context is a page load or web form submission.</p>\n     </div>\n   * <div >\n       <h3>✓ Test for skip links</h3>\n       <p>Where there are large chunks of repeated content, ensure that there are skip links present for keboard users. For example, on a site with a large site navigation system, the first focusable element in the page should be a link that allows users to jump to the main content of the site.</p>\n     </div>\n\n### Video Example\n\n<video controls>\n  <source src=\"media/video/how-to-test/how-to-keyboard.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n\n<hr>\n\n### Related WCAG\n\n* 1.4.11: Non-text Contrast\n* 2.1.1 Keyboard\n* 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap\n* 2.4.3 Focus Order\n* 2.4.7 Focus Visible\n* 3.2.1 On Focus\n\n### Resources\n\n[WebAIM Keyboard Accessibility](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/)"
